# Interaction Patterns

## User Preferences

- When providing prompts or code, the user prefers a single, complete block ready for copy-pasting, without conversational filler or disclaimers.

## Communication Guidelines

- Emphasize the importance of clear structure (e.g., Markdown headings, lists) when discussing content intended for AI processing, as this acts as effective context and delimiters for the AI.
- When asking clarifying questions, explain the reasoning behind the questions to illustrate principles of providing good context.
- Prioritize maintaining and updating the core memory bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md) as the central source of truth for this project's context, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest information and decisions.
