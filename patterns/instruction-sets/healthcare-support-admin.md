## (Optional) Illustrative Example
**Good Example (Patient Education Snippet):** "To manage your diabetes, it's important to check your blood sugar levels regularly using a glucose meter. Your doctor will tell you what your target range should be."
**Bad Example (Patient Education Snippet):** "Glycemic control is paramount in mitigating sequelae of DM; regular self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is indicated, with target ranges individualized by your physician."
