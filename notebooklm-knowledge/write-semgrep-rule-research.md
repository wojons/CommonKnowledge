# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Writing Code Rules to Find Problems in Code (Write Semgrep Rule) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Writing Code Rules to Find Problems in Code (Write Semgrep Rule) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a big LEGO project with lots of different parts, and you want to find all the places where a certain type of brick was used incorrectly! Writing code rules to find problems in code is like doing that for computer code! It's about writing special instructions (called a Semgrep rule) that tell a computer program how to automatically look for and find specific patterns or problems in code! It's about creating rules for finding issues in code.

**What is it?** Semgrep is a computer program that helps find bugs, security problems, and other issues in computer code automatically. A Semgrep rule is a set of instructions written in a special code language that tells Semgrep exactly what pattern or problem to look for in the code. Writing code rules to find problems in code means taking information about a code pattern or a security problem and writing the correct Semgrep rule code. This rule tells Semgrep what to look for in the code to find the problem automatically.
**Why it matters?** Manually reviewing code for problems can take a long time and it's easy to miss things! Writing code rules to find problems helps automate the process, allowing programmers and security experts to quickly and efficiently scan large amounts of code for known issues. This helps find and fix problems faster, making code more reliable and secure. It's about creating automated tools for finding issues in code! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super code checker and writing code rules to find problems in code!

## Core Goal: Generating Code Rules to Automatically Detect Patterns or Problems in Code!
The main point of writing code rules to find problems in code (write Semgrep rule) is to analyze input information (code patterns or vulnerability details) and generate accurate and working Semgrep rules for finding those patterns or vulnerabilities in code.

**What's the goal?** To take information about a code pattern or a security problem and write special code instructions (a Semgrep rule) that tell a computer program how to automatically look for that pattern or problem in code. You make sure the rule is written correctly and that it accurately finds the pattern or problem.
**Why is this the goal?** Because automating the identification of code patterns, bugs, and vulnerabilities is essential for maintaining code quality and security in software development. By generating accurate and working Semgrep rules, you provide developers and security professionals with a powerful tool for automatically scanning codebases and finding known issues. This contributes to improving the overall quality and security of computer code. It's about making sure that problems in code can be found automatically using code rules.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Rule Writing

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to write rules.

### Principle 1: What Should the Computer Look For? (Code Understanding)
Imagine needing to write a rule to find incorrectly used LEGO bricks. You need to understand what the incorrect pattern looks like! This principle means understanding of the code patterns or vulnerabilities to be detected.

**What is it?** Having a clear understanding of the specific code pattern, bug, or vulnerability that you are trying to find with your rule.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the target pattern or problem to write a rule that can accurately find it.
**How to do it:** Read information about the code pattern or vulnerability. How does it look in the code? What are the signs it leaves behind?

### Principle 2: Know the Rule Language! (Semgrep Knowledge)
Imagine needing to write a rule for a computer program, but you don't know the language it understands! This principle means having knowledge of Semgrep rule syntax, patterns, and configurations.

**What is it?** Understanding the specific code language and rules that are used to write rules for the Semgrep program.
**Why it matters:** You need to know the Semgrep language to write correct rules.
**How to do it:** Learn about the different parts of a Semgrep rule, like how to tell it what code pattern to look for.

### Principle 3: Which Language Is It For? (Language Awareness)
Imagine writing a rule for finding problems in English sentences, but you need to use it for Spanish sentences! This principle means understanding the specific programming language the rule is intended for.

**What is it?** Knowing which computer programming language (like Python, Java, or JavaScript) the Semgrep rule is designed to scan.
**Why it matters:** Semgrep rules are often specific to a particular programming language. You need to specify the correct language for the rule to work.
**How to do it:** Identify the programming language of the code you want to scan.

### Principle 4: How Can the Computer Find It? (Detection Logic)
Imagine writing a rule that tells the computer to look for red things, but the incorrect LEGO pattern isn't red! This principle means designing the rule to accurately identify the target pattern or vulnerability.

**What is it?** Figuring out the specific code characteristics or patterns that the Semgrep program needs to look for to accurately find the target pattern, bug, or vulnerability.
**Why it matters:** The rule needs to be able to find the target reliably without finding things that are not actually problems (false positives).
**How to do it:** Based on how the code pattern or vulnerability looks, what specific code elements or structures should Semgrep look for?

### Principle 5: Use the Right Code Words! (Syntax Adherence)
Imagine using the wrong command in the rule language, and the computer doesn't understand! This principle means generating Semgrep rule code that follows the correct grammatical rules of the Semgrep language and YAML format.

**What is it?** Writing the Semgrep rule code using the correct syntax and following the specific rules for how Semgrep rules are written in YAML.
**Why it matters:** If the code has syntax errors, the Semgrep program cannot use the rule.
**How to do it:** Learn the correct Semgrep rule syntax and YAML format.

### Principle 6: Just Show the Code! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the rule code, but you include extra notes! This principle means outputting only the generated Semgrep rule code without additional commentary.

**What is it?** Presenting only the generated Semgrep rule code as the final output, without including any warnings, notes, or other commentary.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a clean block of code that can be used directly by the Semgrep program.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the Semgrep rule code and nothing else.

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be correct rule code, but it has mistakes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including generating accurate and working Semgrep rules.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including generating accurate and working Semgrep rules that follow syntax guidelines and specific language considerations.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated code matches them precisely.
