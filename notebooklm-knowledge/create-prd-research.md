# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Product Plans (Product Requirements Documents) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Product Plans (Product Requirements Documents) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a great idea for a new toy, and you need to explain exactly what the toy should do, how it should work, and what it should look like so that a toy factory can build it. A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is like that detailed plan for building a new computer product! It's a report that explains what a new product should be, what features it needs, and what problems it should solve, so that the people who build it know exactly what to create.

**What is it?** A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a document that describes a product that a company wants to build. Creating one involves: explaining the purpose of the product, who it's for, what features it needs, what problems it should solve, and any other important requirements. You write it in a clear and precise way so that the team who will design and build the product understands exactly what is needed.
**Why it matters?** A PRD is like a blueprint for a new product! It helps make sure that everyone involved in building the product (like designers, programmers, and testers) has a shared understanding of what needs to be created. This helps the team build the right product that meets the needs of the customers. It's about making a clear plan before you start building a new product! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super product planner and creating great PRDs!

## Core Goal: Planning What to Build Clearly and Precisely!
The main point of creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) is to take a product idea or requirements and generate a precise document that outlines the product's purpose, features, and requirements in a clear and structured format for the product team.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of a product idea or its requirements and create a detailed document (a PRD) that explains what the product is, why it's being built, what features it must have, and any other important requirements, all written in a clear and precise way using Markdown.
**Why is this the goal?** Because a PRD serves as a central guide for the product development team. By clearly and precisely documenting the product's requirements, you ensure that everyone involved in the process has a shared understanding of what needs to be built. This minimizes ambiguity, reduces the risk of building the wrong product, and facilitates effective collaboration between product managers, designers, engineers, and testers. It's about providing a clear and accurate roadmap for product development.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Product Planning

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create PRDs well.

### Principle 1: What Should It Do? (Requirements Gathering)
Imagine the toy factory needs to know exactly what the new toy should do, like if it should light up or make sounds. This principle means identifying and understanding all the key features and requirements of the product.

**What is it?** Identifying and clearly defining all the necessary features, functionality, and requirements that the product must have to meet its goals and the needs of its users.
**Why it matters:** The PRD is based on the product's requirements. You need to identify all the important requirements to make sure the product does what it's supposed to do.
**How to do it:** Read the product idea or description carefully. What are the main things the product needs to be able to do? What problems should it solve for users?

### Principle 2: Say It Clearly and Exactly! (Clarity and Precision)
Imagine the plan for the toy says "make noise," but doesn't say what kind of noise or when! This principle means documenting requirements in a clear, unambiguous, and precise manner.

**What is it?** Writing the requirements and descriptions in the PRD using clear, specific, and unambiguous language that leaves no room for misinterpretation.
**Why it matters:** Precision is crucial in a PRD so that the development team knows exactly what to build. Vague requirements can lead to building the wrong thing.
**How to do it:** Use clear and specific language. Avoid vague terms. Describe the requirements in a way that can be easily understood and tested.

### Principle 3: Put It in Order! (Structured Documentation)
Imagine the toy plan has the instructions for painting before the instructions for building! This principle means organizing the product requirements and other information into a standard PRD format with clear sections.

**What is it?** Organizing the product's purpose, features, requirements, and other relevant information into a standard PRD structure with clear headings and sections.
**Why it matters:** A well-structured PRD is easier for the product team to read, navigate, and find the information they need.
**How to do it:** Use standard sections for a PRD, such as Introduction, Goals, User Stories, Features, Requirements, Scope, and Out of Scope. Organize your information under these headings.

### Principle 4: Who Is Building It? (Audience Awareness)
Imagine writing the toy plan for a little kid instead of the toy factory engineers. This principle means creating a document that is useful and easy to understand for the people who will build the product (developers, designers, testers).

**What is it?** Creating a PRD that is written and structured in a way that is useful and easy for the product development team to understand and work with.
**Why it matters:** The PRD is a key communication tool for the product team. It needs to be tailored to their needs.
**How to do it:** Use language and a level of detail that is appropriate for a technical audience. Focus on providing the information that the development team needs to build the product.

### Principle 5: Just Use the Idea You Have! (Objectivity)
Imagine the product plan includes features that weren't in the original idea because you thought they would be cool! This principle means basing the PRD on the product idea and requirements provided in the input, without adding your own ideas or interpretations.

**What is it?** Documenting the product's requirements and features based solely on the information provided in the input description of the product idea or requirements.
**Why it matters:** The PRD should accurately reflect the product that is intended to be built.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting and presenting the requirements that are actually in the input description.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Product Plans Look Like (The Checklist!)

Here's how you can check if your product plan is super good!
