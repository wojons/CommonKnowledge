# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Website Names (Extracting Domains) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Website Names (Extracting Domains) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are reading something online, and you see lots of website addresses like "google.com" or "wikipedia.org." Finding website names (extracting domains) is like reading text and finding all those website addresses! It's about pulling out the main names that identify websites on the internet.

**What is it?** A domain name is the main part of a website address (like "google" in "google.com"). Extracting domains means reading a piece of text and finding all the domain names that are mentioned in the text. You look for the names that people use to find websites online. You then put these names into a clear list.
**Why it matters?** Domain names are important for identifying websites and online resources. By finding and extracting domain names from text, you can quickly create a list of the websites that are mentioned. This can be useful for researching the sources of information, understanding what online resources are being discussed, or identifying potential websites related to a topic. It's about finding the addresses of places on the internet! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super website name finder and extracting domains!

## Core Goal: Finding All the Website Names in a Text!
The main point of finding website names (extracting domains) is to analyze input text and extract all domain names present within the text, outputting them as a list in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find all the names that identify websites (domain names) that are mentioned in the text, and then put all those domain names into a list in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because domain names are key identifiers for online resources. By extracting all domain names from a text, you provide a comprehensive list of the websites referenced or discussed within that content. This is valuable for research, analysis, or simply creating a list of related online resources. It's about making sure that all the website addresses mentioned in a text are easily identifiable and accessible.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Domain Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find domains well.

### Principle 1: Find the Website Names! (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading text and looking for things that look like website addresses. This principle means identifying strings within the text that represent domain names.

**What is it?** Reading the input text and accurately identifying the words or phrases that are formatted as domain names (like example.com, sub.domain.org).
**Why it matters:** You need to find the domain names in the text to extract them.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for patterns of text followed by a dot and then another word (like .com, .org, .net).

### Principle 2: Find All of Them! (Completeness)
Imagine reading text with three website names but only finding two of them! This principle means identifying all domain names present in the text.

**What is it?** Identifying every instance of a domain name that appears in the input text.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a complete list of all domains mentioned.
**How to do it:** Read the text thoroughly and make sure you find every domain name that is present.

### Principle 3: Put It in a List! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the website names are just scattered around! This principle means presenting the extracted domains as a list.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted domain names as a list of items using Markdown bullet points or numbered lists.
**Why it matters:** A list format makes the domain names easy to read and scan.
**How to do it:** Use `-` or `*` at the beginning of each line for a domain name.

### Principle 4: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of website names includes a website you just thought of that wasn't in the text! This principle means reporting the domains as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted domain names based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external domain names.
**Why it matters:** The output should accurately reflect the domains mentioned in the original text.
**How to do it:** Only include the domain names that were actually present in the input text.

### Principle 5: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of website names is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your list of domain names using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
