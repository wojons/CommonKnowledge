# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Explaining Code Changes for Others (Write Pull Request) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Explaining Code Changes for Others (Write Pull Request) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you and your friends are building a big LEGO project together, and you finish adding a new room to the house. You need to show your friends the new room and explain what you did so they can see if it fits with the rest of the house! Explaining code changes for others is like doing that for computer code! It's about showing the changes you made to the code and explaining them clearly so other programmers can understand and approve them! It's about communicating code modifications.

**What is it?** In computer programming, when someone makes changes to code, they often group related changes together into something called a "pull request." A pull request is like a suggestion to add those changes to the main project, and it includes a description of what was done. Explaining code changes means writing that description for a pull request. This pattern involves looking at the exact changes made to the code (using a tool called Git diff) and writing a detailed description that explains what was changed, *why* you made those changes, and if there are any potential problems or bugs you found. The goal is to help other programmers understand and review your changes.
**Why it matters?** When programmers work together on code, they need to understand the changes that others have made before adding them to the main project. A good pull request description helps other programmers quickly see what was modified, understand the reasons for the changes, and check for any potential issues. This is important for keeping the code clean, preventing bugs, and collaborating effectively! It's about making sure your code changes are easy for others to understand and review! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super code explainer and explaining code changes for others!

## Core Goal: Generating Detailed Explanations of Code Changes for Review!
The main point of explaining code changes for others (write pull request) is to analyze Git diff output and generate a detailed pull request description explaining changes, providing reasoning, and identifying potential bugs.

**What's the goal?** To look at the exact changes made to computer code and write a detailed description for a pull request. You explain what was changed, *why* you made those changes, and if you found any potential problems or bugs related to the changes.
**Why is this the goal?** Because clear and detailed pull request descriptions are essential for effective code reviews and collaboration among developers. By analyzing the code changes and providing explanations for the modifications, the reasoning behind them, and identifying potential issues, you facilitate the review process and help ensure that code is integrated smoothly and correctly into the main project. This is valuable for maintaining code quality and preventing bugs. It's about making sure that changes to computer code are well-explained for others to review.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Pull Request Writing

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to write pull requests.

### Principle 1: What Was Added or Changed? (Code Analysis)
Imagine looking at the exact changes made to the LEGO project to see which bricks were added or removed. This principle means understanding the changes represented in the Git diff output.

**What is it?** Examining the output of a Git diff command to understand the specific lines of code that were added, removed, or modified.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the actual code changes to explain them accurately in the pull request description.
**How to do it:** Read the Git diff output carefully. Look for lines starting with `+` (added) or `-` (removed). See what code was changed.

### Principle 2: Explain What You Did! (Explanation)
Imagine showing the new LEGO room and explaining, "I added a window here and moved this wall." This principle means clearly describing the modifications made.

**What is it?** Clearly and understandably describing the specific code changes that were made in the pull request.
**Why it matters:** The description helps other programmers understand what was modified without having to read the code themselves.
**How to do it:** Write sentences that explain the changes you made to the code.

### Principle 3: Explain Why You Did It! (Justification)
Imagine explaining, "I added the window so the room would have more light." This principle means providing the reasons or rationale behind the changes.

**What is it?** Explaining *why* the code changes were necessary or beneficial, providing the context or problem that the changes address.
**Why it matters:** Understanding the reasoning helps other programmers understand the purpose of the changes and if they are appropriate.
**How to do it:** Explain the problem you were trying to solve or the new feature you were trying to add with these changes.

### Principle 4: Look for Problems! (Quality Assurance - Implied)
Imagine looking at the new LEGO room and seeing if any bricks are loose or in the wrong place. This principle means identifying potential issues or bugs based on the diff.

**What is it?** Reviewing the code changes in the diff output to identify any potential errors, bugs, or unintended consequences that might have been introduced.
**Why it matters:** Identifying potential bugs early helps prevent them from being added to the main project.
**How to do it:** Look at the code changes carefully. Could this change cause any problems in other parts of the program?

### Principle 5: Include Everything Needed! (Completeness)
Imagine the description of the new LEGO room is missing important details, like what color the walls are! This principle means including all necessary details in the description.

**What is it?** Including all the important information that other programmers need to understand and review the changes, such as a summary of the changes, the reasoning, and any potential issues.
**Why it matters:** A complete description provides all the necessary context for the review.
**How to do it:** Make sure your pull request description includes all the important information about the changes.

### Principle 6: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting - Implied)
Imagine organizing the explanation of the new LEGO room into different sections, like "What I Changed" and "Why I Changed It." This principle means organizing the description logically.

**What is it?** Structuring the pull request description with clear sections or headings to make it easy to read and understand.
**Why it matters:** A logical structure helps other programmers navigate the description and find the information they need.
**How to do it:** Use headings or bullet points to organize the different parts of your description (e.g., Summary, Changes, Reasoning, Potential Issues).

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be a detailed description, but you output something else! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including generating a detailed pull request description with specified details.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including generating a detailed pull request description that explains changes, provides reasoning, and identifies potential bugs from the git diff command output.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Pull Request Descriptions Look Like (The Checklist!)
