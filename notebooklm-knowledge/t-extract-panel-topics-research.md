# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Suggesting Ideas for Group Talks (T Extract Panel Topics) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Suggesting Ideas for Group Talks (T Extract Panel Topics) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you and your friends are really good at building LEGOs, and you want to have a group talk (a panel) at a LEGO building club meeting to share your ideas! Suggesting ideas for group talks is like thinking about what you and your friends are interested in and coming up with ideas for topics you could all talk about together in front of others! It's about finding good topics for a group discussion.

**What is it?** A panel is a group of people who discuss a topic in front of an audience. Suggesting ideas for group talks means looking at information about a person's interests and goals (like in a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at other information you are given. You then think about what topics would be good for that person to discuss with others in a group talk. You come up with exactly 5 ideas for these talks, each with a title and a description, and present them in a clear list.
**Why it matters?** Group talks (panels) are a great way for people to share different ideas and perspectives on a topic! Suggesting ideas for group talks helps people find relevant and engaging topics that they can discuss together, which is useful for events where people share knowledge. It's about finding good topics for a group of people to talk about! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super group talk idea finder and suggesting ideas for group talks!

## Core Goal: Generating Relevant Ideas for Group Discussions Based on a Person's Interests and Context!
The main point of suggesting ideas for group talks (T Extract Panel Topics) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File), synthesize the information, and generate 5 panel topic ideas with titles and descriptions.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about a person's plans and goals (like in a TELOS File). You then think about how this information can be used to come up with exactly 5 ideas for talks or discussions that person could have with a group of others. You give each idea a title and a description.
**Why is this the goal?** Because generating relevant and engaging topics for panel discussions based on a person's interests and context facilitates their participation in knowledge-sharing events and contributes to creating valuable content for audiences. By synthesizing information from different sources and formulating specific panel ideas with titles and descriptions, you provide actionable suggestions for potential group talks. It's about making sure that people who want to share ideas in a group setting have good topics to discuss.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Panel Topic Generation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to generate panel topics.

### Principle 1: What Do They Care About? (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at information about your friend's LEGO interests and also looking at information about the LEGO building club meeting. This principle means analyzing input text and planning context (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe a person's interests or a specific event) in combination with information about plans, goals, and context (like in a TELOS File) to understand the full picture.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the person's interests and the context of the event to suggest relevant talk ideas.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. What are the person's interests? What is the event about?

### Principle 2: Put the Information Together! (Information Synthesis)
Imagine putting the information about your friend's LEGO interests and the club meeting together to come up with talk ideas. This principle means combining information from different sources (input and TELOS File).

**What is it?** Combining and making sense of the information from the input text and the TELOS File to form a comprehensive understanding that can be used to generate talk ideas.
**Why it matters:** Synthesizing information from different sources provides a holistic view for generating relevant topics.
**How to do it:** Look for connections between the input text and the information in the TELOS File. How do the person's interests relate to the event?

### Principle 3: Come Up with Ideas! (Idea Generation)
Imagine thinking of different ideas for LEGO talks, like "Building Strong LEGO Structures" or "Using Rare LEGO Bricks." This principle means formulating relevant and engaging panel topic ideas.

**What is it?** Creating ideas for topics that a person could discuss with a group of others in a talk or panel setting, ensuring the ideas are relevant to their interests and potentially interesting to an audience.
**Why it matters:** You need to generate specific topic ideas for the person.
**How to do it:** Based on the synthesized information, brainstorm potential topics that the person could talk about with others.

### Principle 4: Give Them Titles and Descriptions! (Structure)
Imagine giving each LEGO talk idea a title like "Building Strong LEGO Structures" and a short explanation of what the talk would be about. This principle means presenting the ideas with clear titles and descriptions.

**What is it?** For each talk or panel idea, creating a clear and engaging title and a concise description that explains what the talk or discussion would cover.
**Why it matters:** Titles and descriptions help people understand what the talk is about and decide if they want to attend.
**How to do it:** For each idea, write a catchy title and a short summary of the topic.

Imagine the output is supposed to be exactly 5 ideas with titles and descriptions, but you only give 3 ideas! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including having exactly 5 ideas with titles and descriptions.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including generating exactly 5 panel ideas and providing a title and description for each one.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely. Double-check that you have exactly 5 ideas with both titles and descriptions.
