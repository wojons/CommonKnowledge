# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Security Reports (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Security Reports and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you find a weak spot in your computer house, like a door that doesn't lock properly! Creating a security report is like writing a note about that weak spot to tell others about it, how dangerous it is, and how to fix it. It's about documenting problems you find that could let bad guys in and explaining how to make things safer.

**What is it?** A security finding is a problem or weak spot found in a computer system that could be exploited by bad guys. A security report is a document that describes this finding. Creating one involves: explaining what the problem is (description), how dangerous it is (risk), what should be done to fix it (recommendations), and where you found information about it (references). You write it in a clear and structured way so that people who need to fix the problem understand it.
**Why it matters?** Security reports are important for fixing weak spots and making computer systems safer! By clearly documenting the problems, their potential danger, and how to fix them, you help security teams understand what needs to be done to protect against bad guys. It's about communicating security issues effectively so they can be addressed! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security reporter and writing great reports about weak spots!

## Core Goal: Documenting Security Problems Clearly So They Can Be Fixed!
The main point of creating security reports is to take information about a security vulnerability or issue and generate a detailed, structured report that describes the finding, assesses its risk, provides recommendations for remediation, and includes supporting references.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of a security finding and create a detailed report in Markdown format that includes specific sections for: describing the problem, assessing how dangerous it is, recommending how to fix it, listing where you found information about it, and providing a short summary and any relevant quotes.
**Why is this the goal?** Because security findings need to be clearly communicated to the individuals or teams responsible for fixing them. A structured report ensures that all necessary information about the finding, its impact, and recommended solutions is presented in an organized and easy-to-understand format. This facilitates efficient remediation and helps improve the overall security posture of the system. It's about making sure that security problems are well-documented and actionable.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Security Reporting

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to report on security.

### Principle 1: Say Exactly What the Problem Is! (Clarity and Detail)
Imagine the report about the unlocked door just says "There's a problem." That's not clear! This principle means describing the security finding accurately and comprehensively.

**What is it?** Providing a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the security vulnerability or issue that was found.
**Why it matters:** The description needs to be clear so that the people who need to fix the problem understand exactly what it is.
**How to do it:** Explain the vulnerability in detail. How does it work? What part of the system is affected?

### Principle 2: How Bad Could It Be? (Risk Assessment)
Imagine the report about the unlocked door doesn't say if it leads to a room with valuable things or just an empty closet. This principle means evaluating the potential impact or danger of the finding.

**What is it?** Assessing the potential risk posed by the security finding, considering how likely it is to be exploited and what the impact would be if it were.
**Why it matters:** Risk assessment helps prioritize which findings are most important to fix first.
**How to do it:** Think about what a bad guy could do if they exploited the vulnerability. How serious would the consequences be?

### Principle 3: How Can We Fix It? (Actionable Guidance)
Imagine the report about the unlocked door doesn't say how to lock it! This principle means providing clear recommendations for how to fix the security finding.

**What is it?** Providing specific, practical, and actionable recommendations for steps that can be taken to remediate (fix) the security vulnerability or issue.
**Why it matters:** Recommendations guide the process of fixing the problem.
**How to do it:** Suggest specific steps to fix the vulnerability, such as updating software, changing configurations, or implementing security controls.

### Principle 4: Show Where You Found Info! (Evidence-Based Reporting)
Imagine the report about the unlocked door doesn't say where you found the information about it. This principle means including references or quotes that support the finding.

**What is it?** Including references to sources of information about the vulnerability (like security advisories or research papers) and any relevant quotes that describe the finding.
**Why it matters:** References and quotes provide evidence for the finding and help others learn more about it.
**How to do it:** If you found information about the vulnerability online or in a document, include a link or a reference to it. If there is a key sentence describing the finding, include it as a quote.

### Principle 5: Put It in Order! (Structured Documentation)
Imagine the report about the unlocked door has the recommendations listed before the description of the problem! This principle means organizing the report into standard sections.

**What is it?** Organizing the security finding information into a standard report structure with clear headings for each section (Description, Risk, Recommendations, References, etc.).
**Why it matters:** A well-structured report is easier for readers to navigate and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the specified section headings to organize your information.

### Principle 6: Say It Briefly Overall! (One-Sentence Summary)
Imagine the report is long, but you need a very short sentence that tells the main idea of the finding. This principle means providing a concise one-sentence summary of the security finding.

**What is it?** Creating a single sentence that briefly summarizes the security finding and its main impact.
**Why it matters:** A one-sentence summary provides a quick overview of the finding.
**How to do it:** Write a short sentence that captures the essence of the security problem.

### Principle 7: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the report is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the report, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the report is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your report using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Security Reports Look Like (The Checklist!)
