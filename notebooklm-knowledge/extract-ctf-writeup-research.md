# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Summarizing Cybersecurity Adventures (Extracting CTF Writeups) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Summarizing Cybersecurity Adventures (Extracting CTF Writeups) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you played a game where you had to solve puzzles and find secrets on a computer, like a treasure hunt for computer experts! That's like a Capture The Flag (CTF) game. A CTF writeup is like writing a story about how you played the game and solved the puzzles. Summarizing cybersecurity adventures (extracting CTF writeups) is about reading someone's story about playing a CTF game and writing a short report that explains how they solved the challenges! It's about summarizing the steps taken in a cybersecurity game.

**What is it?** A cybersecurity engagement can be like a game or a challenge where people use their computer skills to solve problems, like in a CTF game. A writeup is a description of how someone solved a challenge or completed a task in a cybersecurity engagement. Extracting a CTF writeup means reading a story or description of someone playing a CTF game and pulling out the most important steps and details about how they solved the challenges. You then write a short summary of their adventure.
**Why it matters?** CTF games and cybersecurity engagements are a great way to learn and practice cybersecurity skills! By reading writeups, others can learn how challenges were solved and improve their own skills. Summarizing these stories makes it easy to quickly understand the key steps and techniques used in the engagement. It's about sharing knowledge from cybersecurity adventures! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super cybersecurity storyteller and summarizing CTF writeups!

## Core Goal: Summarizing Cybersecurity Adventures Clearly!
The main point of summarizing cybersecurity adventures (extracting CTF writeups) is to analyze input text (a warstory-like text about a cybersecurity engagement) and extract a concise writeup in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a story about a cybersecurity adventure (like playing a CTF game) and write a short report that explains what happened and how the challenges were solved, all written concisely in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because narratives about cybersecurity engagements, like CTF warstories, often contain valuable information about problem-solving techniques and technical approaches. By extracting a concise writeup, you provide a summary that highlights the key steps and methods used in the engagement, making it easy for others to learn from the experience without reading the full story. It's about making the lessons from cybersecurity adventures accessible and easy to understand.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Writeup Creation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create writeups well.

### Principle 1: What Happened in the Adventure? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading the story about the CTF game and figuring out the main challenges and how they were solved. This principle means understanding the narrative of the cybersecurity engagement.

**What is it?** Reading the input text (warstory-like narrative) and analyzing its content to understand the events, challenges, and solutions presented in the cybersecurity engagement.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the adventure to summarize it accurately.
**How to do it:** Read the narrative carefully. What were the main problems faced? How were they overcome?

### Principle 2: Say It Briefly! (Information Condensation)
Imagine the story is long, but you need a short report about the adventure! This principle means reducing the narrative to its most essential points for a concise writeup.

**What is it?** Condensing the key events, challenges, and solutions from the narrative into a concise summary or writeup.
**Why it matters:** The writeup should be brief and easy to read quickly.
**How to do it:** Summarize the main parts of the adventure concisely.

### Principle 3: What Were the Important Parts? (Relevance)
Imagine the story talks about what the player ate for lunch, but that's not important for how they solved the puzzle! This principle means focusing on the key events and technical aspects of the engagement.

**What is it?** Identifying the most important events, technical details, and problem-solving steps that are relevant to the cybersecurity engagement described in the narrative.
**Why it matters:** The writeup should highlight the most valuable information from the adventure.
**How to do it:** As you read, look for descriptions of challenges, how they were solved, and any technical techniques used.

### Principle 4: Say It Clearly and Briefly! (Clarity and Conciseness)
Imagine the report about the adventure is confusing and you don't understand how they solved the puzzle! This principle means presenting the writeup clearly and efficiently.

**What is it?** Writing the writeup using clear, simple, and concise language that is easy for others to understand.
**Why it matters:** The writeup needs to be easy to read and understand quickly.
**How to do it:** Use simple sentences. Avoid unnecessary words. Get straight to the main points of the adventure.

### Principle 5: Just Use What the Story Said! (Objectivity)
Imagine the report about the adventure includes things that weren't in the original story! This principle means summarizing the engagement as presented in the input narrative, without adding your own opinions or interpretation.

**What is it?** Summarizing the cybersecurity engagement based solely on the content provided in the input narrative, without injecting personal opinions or external information.
**Why it matters:** The writeup should accurately reflect the adventure as it was told.
**How to do it:** Focus on summarizing the events and details that are actually in the input narrative.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the report about the adventure is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the writeup is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your writeup using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
