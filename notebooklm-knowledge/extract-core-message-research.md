# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding the Main Point (Extracting Core Message) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding the Main Point (Extracting Core Message) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a whole story, and you want to tell someone the most important idea of the story in just one sentence! Finding the main point (extracting core message) is like reading something and figuring out the single most important idea that the author wants you to understand, and then saying it in a very short and clear sentence! It's about getting to the heart of what something is about.

**What is it?** The core message of a piece of writing is the single most important idea or main point that the author is trying to communicate. Finding the core message means reading the writing and figuring out what that one main idea is. You then write a clear and concise sentence that expresses this main idea.
**Why it matters?** Understanding the main point of what you read is super important for learning and remembering! By finding the core message, you can quickly grasp what the writing is about and share that main idea with others. It helps you focus on what's most important and not get lost in all the details. It's about getting to the heart of the matter! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super main point finder and getting to the core message of any writing!

## Core Goal: Finding the Single Most Important Idea in a Text!
The main point of finding the main point (extracting core message) is to analyze input text and extract the single most important message, expressing it as a clear and concise sentence in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and figure out the one most important idea that the author wants to share, and then write that idea as a clear and short sentence in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying the core message is fundamental to understanding any piece of communication. By extracting the single most important idea and expressing it concisely, you provide a clear and easily digestible summary of the text's central theme. This is valuable for quickly grasping the essence of a document or body of work and communicating its main point to others. It's about distilling complex content down to its most essential message.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Message Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find the main point.

### Principle 1: What's the Biggest Idea? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading a story and thinking, "What is the one most important thing I should remember from this story?" This principle means understanding the input text to identify its main point.

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to understand its overall content, main ideas, and the central message the author is trying to convey.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text to find its core message.
**How to do it:** Read the text multiple times. What is the main topic? What is the author's main argument or point?

### Principle 2: Say It in One Short Sentence! (Information Condensation)
Imagine trying to explain the whole story in just one sentence! This principle means reducing the entire text to a single sentence that captures its essence.

**What is it?** Synthesizing the main ideas of the text into a single, clear, and concise sentence that articulates the core message.
**Why it matters:** The core message should be expressed briefly and clearly in one sentence.
**How to do it:** After identifying the main point, write a sentence that summarizes it. Make sure it is only one sentence and is easy to understand.

### Principle 3: Say It Clearly and Briefly! (Clarity and Conciseness)
Imagine the one sentence is confusing and you don't understand the main point! This principle means expressing the core message clearly and efficiently in one sentence.

**What is it?** Writing the core message sentence using clear, simple, and concise language that is easy for others to understand.
**Why it matters:** The core message needs to be easy to grasp quickly.
**How to do it:** Use simple words and a straightforward sentence structure. Avoid unnecessary words.

### Principle 4: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the one sentence includes your own idea that wasn't in the story! This principle means identifying the core message as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Identifying the core message based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external ideas.
**Why it matters:** The core message should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on summarizing the main point that is actually in the input text.

### Principle 5: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the one sentence is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the core message is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your core message sentence using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
