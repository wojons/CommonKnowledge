# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Recipes (Extracting Recipes) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Recipes (Extracting Recipes) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read about a delicious cookie recipe, and you want to find the list of ingredients and the steps to make them! Finding recipes is like reading text and finding all the parts that tell you how to make a meal â€“ the name of the meal, what you need (ingredients), and how to cook it (steps)! It's about pulling out the instructions for making food.

**What is it?** A recipe is a set of instructions for preparing a dish, including a list of ingredients and the steps to follow. Extracting a recipe means reading a piece of writing that contains a recipe and identifying the different parts: a short description of the meal, the list of ingredients with how much of each you need (measurements), and the step-by-step instructions for cooking. You then present these parts of the recipe.
**Why it matters?** Recipes are essential for cooking! By finding and extracting recipes from text, you can easily get the instructions you need to make a meal. This is useful for trying new dishes, sharing recipes with others, or organizing your favorite recipes. It's about finding the instructions for making delicious food! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super recipe finder and extracting recipes!

## Core Goal: Finding All the Parts of a Recipe in a Text!
The main point of finding recipes (extracting recipes) is to analyze input text containing a recipe and extract the meal description, ingredients with measurements, and preparation steps, outputting them in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text that has a recipe and find the short description of the meal, the list of ingredients with how much of each you need, and the step-by-step instructions for cooking, and then put those parts of the recipe in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because recipes are structured information that is valuable for cooking and meal preparation. By extracting the key components of a recipe (description, ingredients, steps) from text, you provide a clear and usable guide for preparing the dish. This facilitates cooking and allows users to easily access and follow recipes found in various sources. It's about making sure that recipes are easily identifiable and presented in a format that is easy to follow in the kitchen.
