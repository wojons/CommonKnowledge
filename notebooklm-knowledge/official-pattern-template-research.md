# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Instructions for Smart Computers (Official Pattern Template) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Instructions for Smart Computers (Official Pattern Template) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you want to teach a smart robot how to do a new job, like sorting toys. You need to write down clear instructions for the robot! Creating instructions for smart computers (official pattern template) is like having a special form or guide to help you write good instructions for a smart computer program (like an AI) so it knows exactly what you want it to do! It's about having a template for making new "patterns" of instructions.

**What is it?** A pattern is a set of instructions that tells a smart computer program what its job is, what its goals are, how to do the job step-by-step, and what kind of answer or output to give. An official pattern template is like a blank form with sections for all the important parts of the instructions, along with examples to show you how to fill it out. It helps you write clear and complete instructions for the computer.
**Why it matters?** Smart computers need very clear and organized instructions to perform tasks correctly! If the instructions are messy or missing important parts, the computer might get confused or give you the wrong result. Using a template helps you make sure you include all the necessary information in your instructions so the computer can understand and do the job well. It's about making sure your instructions are clear and complete! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super instruction writer and creating instructions for smart computers!

## Core Goal: Providing a Guide for Writing Clear and Complete Instructions for AI!
The main point of creating instructions for smart computers (official pattern template) is to provide a template and guidance for creating new patterns, outlining the necessary sections and providing examples for defining the AI's role, goals, steps, and output.

**What's the goal?** To provide a special form (a template) that helps people write clear and complete instructions for a smart computer program (an AI). The template has sections for things like what the AI's job is, what it needs to achieve, how it should do the job step-by-step, and what kind of answer it should give. It also includes examples to show how to fill out the sections.
**Why is this the goal?** Because writing effective instructions for AI requires careful consideration of the AI's role, the task objectives, the process steps, and the desired output format. A template provides a structured framework that guides users in defining these elements clearly and comprehensively, increasing the likelihood that the AI will understand and perform the task correctly. It's about making sure that the instructions given to AI are well-organized and easy to follow.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Pattern Creation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create good patterns.

### Principle 1: Say What the Computer's Job Is! (Clear Definition)
Imagine telling the robot to sort toys without telling it *what kind* of robot it is or *what its main job is*. This principle means clearly defining the AI's role, goals, and how it should accomplish the task.

**What is it?** Clearly stating the AI's identity (what kind of expert it is), its overall purpose, and the specific goals it needs to achieve when using this pattern.
**Why it matters:** Defining the AI's role and goals helps it understand the context of the task and what it is expected to accomplish.
**How to do it:** Fill in the "IDENTITY" and "GOALS" sections of the template with clear and specific descriptions.

### Principle 2: Put It in Order! (Structured Instruction)
Imagine giving the robot all the instructions for sorting toys in a random order! This principle means organizing instructions into logical sections (identity, goals, steps, output).

**What is it?** Arranging the instructions for the AI into distinct sections with clear headings, such as Identity, Goals, Steps, and Output.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the instructions easy for the AI to read, understand, and follow.
**How to do it:** Use the provided sections in the template to organize the different parts of your instructions.

### Principle 3: Show Me How! (Exemplification)
Imagine telling the robot how to sort toys but not showing it what a sorted pile should look like. This principle means providing examples to illustrate desired behavior and output format.

**What is it?** Including examples of how the AI should behave, what kind of input it might receive, and what the desired output should look like.
**Why it matters:** Examples can help the AI understand the instructions more clearly, especially for complex tasks or specific output formats.
**How to do it:** Include examples in the "EXAMPLES," "POSITIVE EXAMPLES," and "NEGATIVE EXAMPLES" sections of the template.

### Principle 4: Say What *Not* to Do! (Constraint Specification)
Imagine telling the robot to sort toys but not telling it *not* to throw them! This principle means clearly outlining any limitations or negative constraints on the AI's response.

**What is it?** Explicitly stating any rules or things the AI should avoid doing in its response, such as not using certain words, not including extra commentary, or not using specific formatting.
**Why it matters:** Constraints help ensure the AI's output is appropriate and meets specific requirements.
**How to do it:** Include negative constraints in the "OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS" section (e.g., "Do not output warnings," "Do not use bold").

### Principle 5: How to Do the Job! (Defining Steps)
Imagine telling the robot to sort toys but not telling it *how* to sort them step-by-step. This principle means breaking down the task into a sequence of clear, actionable steps for the AI to follow.

**What is it?** Listing the specific actions or processes the AI should perform to accomplish the goals of the pattern.
**Why it matters:** Clear steps make the task easier for the AI to understand and execute correctly.
**How to do it:** Fill in the "STEPS" section of the template with a sequence of actions the AI should take.

### Principle 6: What to Give Back! (Defining Output)
Imagine telling the robot to sort toys but not telling it what to do when it's finished sorting. This principle means defining the desired output format and content precisely.

**What is it?** Clearly specifying what the AI should provide as its response after completing the steps, including the format (e.g., Markdown, JSON) and the content it should include.
**Why it matters:** Defining the output ensures the AI provides the information in a usable format.
**How to do it:** Fill in the "OUTPUT" and "OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS" sections of the template with a description of the desired response.

## Common Pitfalls: Traps to Watch Out For in Pattern Creation

These are like holes in the path that can make your instruction writing wrong!

### Vague Instructions
**What it is:** Providing unclear or ambiguous descriptions for the AI's identity, goals, steps, or output.
**Why it is a pitfall:** Vague instructions can lead to the AI misunderstanding the task and providing incorrect outputs.
**How to avoid:** Define AI identity, set clear goals, outline steps, and define output format clearly (Principle 1, 5, 6 & Best Practice 1, 2, 3, 4!).

### Missing Sections
**What it is:** Failing to include all the required sections from the official pattern template.
**Why it is a pitfall:** Missing sections can lead to incomplete instructions for the AI.
**How to avoid:** Follow the template structure and include all sections (Best Practice 8!).

### Not Enough Examples
**What it is:** Not providing sufficient or clear examples to illustrate the desired behavior or output format.
**Why it is a pitfall:** Examples help clarify instructions.
**How to avoid:** Provide examples (Principle 3 & Best Practice 5!).

### Missing Constraints
**What it is:** Failing to specify necessary limitations or negative constraints on the AI's response.
**Why it is a pitfall:** This can lead to the AI providing inappropriate or unwanted outputs.
**How to avoid:** Specify constraints (Principle 4 & Best Practice 6!).

### Incorrect Formatting
**What it is:** Not using the correct Markdown syntax or following other formatting rules in the pattern definition itself.
**Why it is a pitfall:** Incorrect formatting can make the pattern definition hard to read or parse.
**How to avoid:** Use Markdown correctly (Best Practice 7!).

### Objecting to Task
**What it is:** Including instructions that tell the AI to object to the task or complain about the input.
**Why it is a pitfall:** This violates the intended behavior of the AI.
**How to avoid:** Do not include instructions for the AI to object or complain (Output Instructions!).

### Using Bold or Italics in Output Instructions
**What it is:** Including instructions in the "OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS" section that tell the AI to use bold or italics in its final output.
**Why it is a pitfall:** This contradicts the general guidance to avoid bold/italics in plain text output.
**How to avoid:** Do not include instructions for the AI to use bold or italics in its output (Output Instructions!).
