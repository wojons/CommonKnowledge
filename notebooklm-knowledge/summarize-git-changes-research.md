# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Summarizing Recent Code Changes (Summarize Git Changes) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Summarizing Recent Code Changes (Summarize Git Changes) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you and your friends are building a big LEGO project together, and you want to quickly tell everyone what new parts were added or changed in the last week! Summarizing recent code changes is like doing that for computer code! It's about looking at the history of changes made to a computer program (using a tool called Git) and giving a short, exciting summary of what's new and important!

**What is it?** Git is a tool that helps people keep track of changes to computer code. When people work on code together, they make changes and save them in Git. Summarizing recent code changes means looking at the changes that were saved in the last few days (like the last 7 days) and creating a short summary that highlights the most important new things that were added or changed. You also look at the main groups of changes (like "pull requests") and describe what they did in a way that's easy for people to understand. You do this in a way that sounds exciting and enthusiastic!
**Why it matters?** When teams work on computer code, many changes can happen quickly! Summarizing recent changes helps everyone on the team stay updated on what's new and important without having to look at every single change themselves. This helps teams work together better and understand how the project is evolving. It's about keeping everyone in the loop about what's new in the code! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super code news reporter and summarizing recent code changes!

## Core Goal: Highlighting Important Recent Updates in Computer Code with Enthusiasm!
The main point of summarizing recent code changes (summarize Git changes) is to analyze recent Git commit history (last 7 days), summarize key project updates with enthusiasm, and list top pull requests with human-readable descriptions.

**What's the goal?** To look at the history of changes made to computer code in the last week and create a short, exciting summary of the most important new things. You also find the main groups of changes (pull requests) and describe what they did in a way that's easy for people to understand.
**Why is this the goal?** Because keeping teams informed about recent code changes is essential for collaboration, project awareness, and understanding the evolution of the codebase. By providing a concise and enthusiastic summary of key updates and human-readable descriptions of significant pull requests, you facilitate communication within the team and ensure that everyone is aware of the most important recent developments. It's about making sure that news about code changes is easy to understand and exciting to share.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Code News

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to report on code news.

### Principle 1: What's New and Important? (Information Extraction)
Imagine looking at all the new LEGO pieces added to the project and picking out the most important ones. This principle means identifying key changes and pull requests from Git history.

**What is it?** Examining the history of changes made to the computer code (using Git) to find the most significant updates, new features, bug fixes, or other important modifications that happened recently (like in the last 7 days).
**Why it matters:** You need to find the most important changes to include in your summary and list of pull requests.
**How to do it:** Look at the recent commits and pull requests in the Git history. What were the main things that were added or changed?

### Principle 2: Make It Sound Exciting! (Tone Adherence)
Imagine telling your friends about the new LEGO parts in a boring voice. This principle means maintaining an enthusiastic tone in the summary.

**What is it?** Writing the summary of the recent code updates in a way that sounds exciting, positive, and enthusiastic.
**Why it matters:** An enthusiastic tone makes the summary more engaging and helps share the excitement about the project's progress.
**How to do it:** Use positive and exciting words in your summary (e.g., "Awesome new features!", "Exciting updates!").

### Principle 3: Explain It Simply! (Clarity)
Imagine describing the new LEGO parts using complicated words that your friends don't understand. This principle means providing human-readable descriptions for technical changes (PRs).

**What is it?** Writing descriptions of the main groups of code changes (pull requests) in a way that is easy for anyone to understand, even if they are not experts in that specific part of the code.
**Why it matters:** Human-readable descriptions help everyone on the team understand what was changed without having to read the code themselves.
**How to do it:** For each pull request, explain in simple terms what problem it solved or what new feature it added.

### Principle 4: Focus on the Best Parts! (Relevance)
Imagine only talking about the smallest, least important LEGO changes. This principle means focusing on key changes and top pull requests.

**What is it?** Selecting the most significant or impactful changes and the most important pull requests to include in the summary and list.
**Why it matters:** Focusing on the most relevant updates helps people stay informed about the most important progress in the project.
**How to do it:** Identify the changes or pull requests that had the biggest impact on the project or added the most important new features.

### Principle 5: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting the exciting summary in one section and the list of changes in another. This principle means presenting the summary and PRs in a specific format.

**What is it?** Organizing the enthusiastic summary and the list of top pull requests with their descriptions into predefined Markdown sections with clear headings.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the code news easy to read and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the provided headings for the summary and the list of pull requests.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including using Markdown and the specified sections.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and presenting the summary and list of pull requests in the specified sections.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
