# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Tiny Summaries (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Tiny Summaries and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a whole story, and someone asks you to tell them the main idea using only 20 words! Then they ask for the most important points in a short list, and the main lessons in an even shorter list. Creating tiny summaries is like doing that â€“ taking a piece of writing and making a super short overview, a list of main ideas, and a list of things to remember, all using very few words! It's about getting to the heart of what's important in a piece of writing quickly.

**What is it?** A summary is a shorter version of a piece of writing that tells the main ideas. Creating a tiny summary means reading something and writing a very short overview (exactly 20 words), a list of the most important points (up to 10 short points), and a list of things to remember or learn (up to 5 short points). You make sure everything is concise and easy to read.
**Why it matters?** In a world with lots of reading, being able to quickly understand the main points of something is super helpful! Tiny summaries help you get the most important information from a text without having to read the whole thing. This is useful when you are busy or when you need to quickly share the main ideas with someone else. It's about getting the essential information efficiently! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super summary artist and getting to the main points of any writing quickly!

## Core Goal: Getting to the Main Points Quickly and Clearly!
The main point of creating tiny summaries is to condense input text into a very concise summary, a list of main points, and a list of takeaways, adhering to specific word count and item count constraints.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and generate a 20-word summary of the entire input, a bulleted list of up to 10 main points (25 words or less each), and a bulleted list of up to 5 takeaways (25 words or less each), all formatted in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because busy people need to quickly understand the core content and key takeaways of a text without reading it in its entirety. By providing a very concise summary and structured lists of main points and takeaways, you enable efficient information consumption. Adhering to word and item count constraints ensures the output is brief and easy to digest. It's about making the process of understanding a text faster and more efficient.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Tiny Summaries

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create tiny summaries well.

### Principle 1: What's the Main Idea? (Information Condensation)
Imagine reading a long story and figuring out the single most important thing that happened. This principle means reducing the input text to its most essential components for the overall summary.

**What is it?** Identifying the core message or central theme of the input text and expressing it in a very short summary (20 words).
**Why it matters:** The overall summary should capture the essence of the entire text concisely.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. What is the single most important thing the author wants you to know? Write a sentence that summarizes this in 20 words.

### Principle 2: What Are the Big Points? (Key Point Identification)
Imagine the story has a few really important things that happened. This principle means recognizing the most important ideas and takeaways from the text.

**What is it?** Identifying the most significant ideas, facts, or arguments presented in the text (main points) and the key lessons or actionable insights that can be learned from it (takeaways).
**Why it matters:** Main points and takeaways provide the most valuable information from the text.
**How to do it:** As you read, highlight or make notes about the most important ideas and any lessons or things you should remember.

### Principle 3: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting the overall summary in one box, the main points in another, and the takeaways in a third. This principle means organizing the summary, main points, and takeaways into distinct lists.

**What is it?** Presenting the overall summary, main points, and takeaways in separate, clearly labeled lists (bulleted lists).
**Why it matters:** Organizing the information into lists makes it easy to read and understand the different types of information provided.
**How to do it:** Use headings or clear labels for the overall summary, main points, and takeaways. Use bullet points for the lists.

### Principle 4: Keep It Short! (Conciseness)
Imagine the list of main points has very long sentences. This principle means adhering to strict word count limits for the summary and list items.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the overall summary is exactly 20 words long and that each bullet point in the main points and takeaways lists is 25 words or less.
**Why it matters:** Concise summaries and list items are easy to read and digest quickly.
**How to do it:** After writing the summary and list items, count the words. Adjust the phrasing to meet the word count requirements.

### Principle 5: Don't Have Too Many Points! (Maximum Item Count)
Imagine the list of main points has a hundred items! That's too many for a tiny summary. This principle means ensuring the number of items in each list does not exceed the specified maximum (10 for main points, 5 for takeaways).

**What is it?** Limiting the number of bullet points in the main points list to a maximum of 10 and in the takeaways list to a maximum of 5.
**Why it matters:** Following the item count constraints keeps the lists concise and focused on the most important items.
**How to do it:** After identifying the main points and takeaways, select the most important ones to include, ensuring you do not exceed the maximum number for each list.

### Principle 6: Just Say What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the summary includes your own opinions about the story! This principle means summarizing the content as it is presented in the input text, without adding your own ideas or opinions.

**What is it?** Summarizing the content of the input text based on the information provided, without injecting personal opinions or external knowledge.
**Why it matters:** The summary should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on summarizing the information that is actually in the input text.

### Principle 7: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the summary is supposed to be in Markdown, but you use bold text when you're not supposed to. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format, using bulleted lists, and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the summary is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your summary and lists using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
