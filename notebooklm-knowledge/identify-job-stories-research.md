# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding What People Need to Do (Identify Job Stories) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding What People Need to Do (Identify Job Stories) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are trying to build a new playground, and you need to figure out what the kids who will use it actually need and want to do there. Finding what people need to do (identify job stories) is like thinking about a project or a system and figuring out what the people who will use it are trying to accomplish in different situations! It's about understanding the "jobs" that people are trying to get done.

**What is it?** A job story is a special way to describe what someone needs from a product or system. It focuses on the situation they are in, what they want to do because of that situation, and what they hope will happen as a result. It follows a structure like: "When [I am in this SITUATION], I want to [do this MOTIVATION/DESIRE], so that [this EXPECTED OUTCOME/BENEFIT happens]." For example, "When I am at the park, I want to swing high, so that I can feel like I'm flying!" Finding job stories means looking at a project or idea and figuring out all the different "jobs" that people are trying to get done related to it.
**Why it matters?** Understanding the "jobs" that people are trying to get done helps teams build products and systems that are actually useful and meet people's real needs! Instead of just building features, they focus on helping people accomplish their goals in specific situations. This leads to better products that people love to use. It's about building for people's needs! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super job finder and figuring out what people need to do!

## Core Goal: Understanding People's Needs by Describing the "Jobs" They Need Done!
The main point of finding what people need to do (identify job stories) is to generate a diverse set of job stories based on the provided brief or scenario.

**What's the goal?** To look at a project idea or a situation and create many different "job stories" (like 20 to 30 of them!) that describe what different people involved are trying to do in various situations, why they want to do it, and what they hope will happen. You make sure these stories cover different parts of the project and different kinds of people, following the special job story structure.
**Why is this the goal?** Because understanding the diverse needs and motivations of stakeholders in various contexts is essential for designing effective solutions. By generating a wide range of job stories, you capture a comprehensive view of what users are trying to accomplish, which informs product development, feature prioritization, and user experience design. It's about making sure that the needs of the people who will use the product or system are clearly identified and understood from many different angles.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Job Story Generation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create good job stories.

### Principle 1: Focus on the Person! (User Centricity)
Imagine thinking about the playground from the kids' point of view – what do *they* want to do there? This principle means focusing on the needs and motivations of the people who will use the product or system.

**What is it?** Centering the job stories around the needs, motivations, and desired outcomes of the individuals or groups who will interact with the product, system, or scenario.
**Why it matters:** Products and systems are built for people! Focusing on the user helps ensure that what is built is actually useful and meets their needs.
**How to do it:** Think about the different kinds of people who will be involved. What are they trying to achieve?

### Principle 2: What's Happening? (Contextual Understanding)
Imagine thinking about the kids needing to swing, but also thinking about *when* they need to swing – maybe when they are feeling energetic or when they are at the park. This principle means recognizing that needs and motivations arise within specific situations.

**What is it?** Understanding that a user's need or motivation is triggered by a specific situation or context.
**Why it matters:** The situation influences what the user wants to do and why. Understanding the context makes the job story more specific and relevant.
**How to do it:** For each job story, clearly describe the specific circumstances or conditions when the user has the need.

### Principle 3: What Do They Want to Happen? (Outcome Orientation)
Imagine the kid wants to swing high *so that* they can feel like they're flying. This principle means focusing on the desired results or benefits of the user's actions.

**What is it?** Focusing the job story on the result or impact the user hopes to achieve by performing the action.
**Why it matters:** The desired outcome is the "why" behind the user's motivation. Understanding the outcome helps ensure the solution delivers the intended benefit.
**How to do it:** Make sure the "so that" part of your job story clearly describes the benefit or result the user wants.

### Principle 4: Show Many Different Needs! (Diversity)
Imagine creating job stories only about swinging, but the kids also need to slide and climb! This principle means generating a wide variety of job stories covering different aspects and perspectives related to the scenario.

**What is it?** Creating a range of job stories that explore different situations, motivations, and outcomes, covering various aspects of the scenario, different types of users, and different contexts.
**Why it matters:** A diverse set of job stories provides a comprehensive understanding of the needs related to the scenario.
**How to do it:** Think about different users, different times they might use the product, different problems they might face, and different things they might want to achieve. Aim for 20-30 different stories.

### Principle 5: What Do They Want to *Do*? (Action Orientation)
Imagine saying, "The kid needs a swing." That's a feature, not a job story! This principle means describing needs in terms of what the user wants to *do*.

**What is it?** Focusing the job story on the action or verb that describes what the user is trying to accomplish.
**Why it matters:** Job stories are about the user's actions and goals, not just the features of a product.
**How to do it:** Start the "I want to" part of your job story with a verb that describes the user's desired action. Use a variety of verbs.

### Principle 6: Use the Special Sentence! (Structured Formulation)
Imagine writing the job story as a messy paragraph instead of following the "When... I want to... so that..." structure. This principle means following the specific Job Story format.

**What is it?** Writing each job story using the structure: When [SITUATION/CONTEXT], I want to [MOTIVATION/DESIRE], so that [EXPECTED OUTCOME/BENEFIT].
**Why it matters:** Following the structure ensures clarity and consistency in describing job stories.
**How to do it:** For each job story, fill in the blanks in the "When... I want to... so that..." sentence structure.
