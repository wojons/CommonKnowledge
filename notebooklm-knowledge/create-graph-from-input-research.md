# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Preparing Data for Graphs (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Preparing Data for Graphs and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a list of how many cookies you sold each day for a week, and you want to draw a picture (a graph) to show how your sales changed over time. But the list is messy! Preparing data for graphs is like taking that messy list of cookie sales and organizing it neatly in a special way so you can easily use it to draw a clear picture that shows your progress. It's about getting numbers ready to be shown in a graph.

**What is it?** Data is information, often numbers or facts. A graph is a picture that shows how data is related (like how cookie sales changed each day). Preparing data for graphs means taking information that shows how something changed over time (like how a security program is improving) and putting it into a specific format that a computer program can use to draw a graph. This format is often a CSV file, which is like a table of numbers and words separated by commas. You make sure the data is organized correctly and only includes the numbers needed for the graph.
**Why it matters?** Graphs are a great way to see patterns and understand data quickly! By preparing data correctly, you make it easy to create clear pictures that show progress, trends, or how things are changing. This helps people understand the data better and make smart decisions based on it. It's about turning numbers into a picture that tells a story! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super data organizer and getting numbers ready for graphs!

## Core Goal: Organizing Numbers to Show Progress in Pictures!
The main point of preparing data for graphs is to take information that shows how something is changing over time and format it into a clear, structured file (like a CSV) that can be used to create a visual graph.

**What's the goal?** To analyze input data that shows how a security program (or something similar) is improving over time, extract the dates and the numbers (metrics), and put them into a CSV file with specific columns (like Date and the names of the metrics) so that a graph can be easily created from it.
**Why is this the goal?** Because visualizing data over time is a powerful way to show progress and identify trends. By formatting the data into a standard and clean format like CSV, you make it easy to import that data into graphing tools and create clear visual representations of improvement. This helps communicate the success of a program or initiative to others. It's about making the data ready to tell its story visually.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Data Preparation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to prepare data for graphs well.

### Principle 1: Find the Numbers That Change Over Time! (Data Identification)
Imagine looking at your cookie sales notes and finding the numbers for each day. This principle means finding the data in the input that shows how something is progressing or changing over time.

**What is it?** Identifying the specific data points within the input that represent measurements or metrics taken at different points in time, showing progress or change.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the data that shows change over time to create a graph that shows progress.
**How to do it:** Read the input carefully. Look for numbers or values that are associated with dates or time periods. These are your progress data points.

### Principle 2: Pull Out the Facts! (Data Extraction)
Imagine copying the cookie sales numbers and the dates from your notes. This principle means accurately pulling out the relevant data points from the input.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the date information and the corresponding numerical values for the metrics or KPIs from the input data.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct numbers and dates to create an accurate graph.
**How to do it:** For each time period, identify the date and the value of the metric(s) you are tracking. Copy these accurately.

### Principle 3: Put It in a Table! (Data Structuring)
Imagine drawing a table with columns for "Day" and "Cookies Sold" and putting your numbers in the right boxes. This principle means organizing the extracted data into a tabular format suitable for a CSV file.

**What is it?** Arranging the extracted date and metric data into rows and columns, where each row represents a point in time and each column represents a specific piece of information (like the date or a metric value).
**Why it matters:** CSV files are structured as tables. Organizing your data this way is necessary to create a valid CSV.
**How to do it:** Create a header row with column names (like "Date" and the names of your metrics). For each date, create a new row and put the date and the corresponding metric values in the correct columns.

### Principle 4: Follow the Rules for the File! (Format Adherence)
Imagine the graph program needs the dates in a specific format, or it only wants numbers in the data columns. This principle means following the specific requirements for the CSV output format and content.

**What is it?** Adhering to the specific requirements for the CSV file, such as using a comma or tab to separate values, ensuring only numerical values are in the data fields, and using the original field names from the input for the columns.
**Why it matters:** The graphing program needs the data in a specific format to read it correctly. Following the rules ensures the CSV is valid and usable.
**How to do it:** Make sure your data is separated by the correct character (usually a comma). Check that the columns that should contain numbers only contain numbers. Use the exact names for the columns as they were in the input data.

### Principle 5: Just Use the Numbers You Have! (Objectivity)
Imagine making up cookie sales numbers because you wanted the graph to look better! This principle means using only the data that is presented in the input and not adding your own numbers or changing the data.

**What is it?** Using only the data points provided in the input for the CSV file, without adding, removing, or altering the original data.
**Why it matters:** The CSV file should be an accurate representation of the input data.
**How to do it:** Only include the dates and metric values that were present in the original input.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Data Preparation Looks Like (The Checklist!)

Here's how you can check if your data organizing is super good!

### You Found the Right Numbers (Data Identification and Extraction)
**What it means:** You correctly identified and pulled out the data that shows progress over time.
**Why it matters:** You need the right data to show progress.

### It's in a Clear Table (Data Structuring)
**What it means:** The data is organized into rows and columns like a table.
**Why it matters:** A table structure is needed for CSV.

### The File Follows the Rules (Format Adherence)
**What it means:** The CSV file uses the correct separators, only has numbers in data fields, and uses the right column names.
**Why it matters:** The file needs to be in the correct format for graphing.

### You Only Used the Numbers You Had (Objectivity)
**What it means:** You only included the data that was in the original input.
**Why it matters:** The CSV should be an accurate representation of the input.
