# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Asking Secure Design Questions (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Asking Secure Design Questions and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you're building a treehouse, and you want to make sure it's super strong and safe so nobody falls out! Asking secure design questions is like asking important questions *before* you start building to make sure the treehouse is safe from the very beginning, not just trying to add safety features after it's built. It's about thinking about safety and security right from the start of any project.

**What is it?** "Secure by design" means thinking about security and safety when you are first planning and designing something, like a computer system, a building, or even a toy. Asking secure design questions means asking specific questions during the planning stage to make sure that security is built into the design from the ground up. These questions help you think about potential dangers and how to protect against them.
**Why it matters?** It's much easier and cheaper to build security in from the beginning than to try and add it later! If you don't think about security when you design something, it might have weak spots that bad guys can exploit or that could lead to accidents. Asking secure design questions helps you identify potential problems early and build a strong and safe project from the start. It's about being proactive in preventing problems! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super safety planner and asking the right questions to build things securely!

## Core Goal: Building Security In From the Start!
The main point of asking secure design questions is to generate a set of important questions that help ensure a project is designed with security and safety as a fundamental part of the plan, not just something added later.

**What's the goal?** To analyze a project or system idea and create a list of prioritized questions that should be asked during the design phase to make sure security is built into the plan from the very beginning.
**Why is this the goal?** Because security is most effective when it's a core part of the design, not an afterthought. By asking the right questions early, project teams can identify potential security risks, choose secure technologies and architectures, and build in necessary protections from the start. This helps prevent vulnerabilities and makes the final project much more secure and reliable. It's about making sure the foundation is strong and safe.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Secure Design Questions

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to ask secure design questions.

### Principle 1: Think About All the Parts! (Comprehensive Coverage)
Imagine building a treehouse and only thinking about the floor, but not the walls or the roof! You need to think about all the parts to make it safe. This principle means asking questions about security for all the different parts and aspects of the project or system you are designing.

**What is it?** Generating questions that cover various security aspects of a project or system, such as how people will log in (authentication), who is allowed to access what (authorization), how data will be protected, and how different parts of the system will communicate securely.
**Why it matters:** Security needs to be considered for every part of a project. If you only focus on one area, you might leave other areas vulnerable.
**How to do it:** Think about all the different components of the project. For each component, ask security questions. Also think about how the components interact with each other.

### Principle 2: What Could Go Wrong? (Risk Identification - Implied)
Imagine thinking about the treehouse and asking, "What if someone tries to climb up without the ladder?" This principle means asking questions that help uncover potential security weaknesses or dangers.

**What is it?** Formulating questions that prompt thinking about potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks that the project or system might face.
**Why it matters:** Secure design is about preventing problems. Questions that highlight potential risks help the design team think about how to mitigate those risks.
**How to do it:** For each part of the system, ask "what if" questions. What if a bad guy tries to steal data? What if the system is attacked?

### Principle 3: Ask the Most Important Questions First! (Prioritization)
Imagine building the treehouse and having a list of safety questions, but some are more important than others, like "Is the floor strong?" versus "Should we paint it green?" This principle means deciding which security questions are most important to ask and address first.

**What is it?** Ranking the security questions based on their importance for the project's overall security posture.
**Why it matters:** Some security considerations are more critical than others. Prioritizing questions helps the design team focus on the most important security aspects first.
**How to do it:** Think about which questions relate to the most serious potential dangers or the most fundamental security requirements. These are likely the highest priority questions.

### Principle 4: Put Similar Questions Together! (Structured Inquiry)
Imagine having a list of safety questions for the treehouse, and you group all the questions about the ladder together. This principle means organizing related security questions into themes.

**What is it?** Grouping related security questions under specific themes or categories, such as "Architecture," "Authentication," "Data Protection," or "Communication Security."
**Why it matters:** Grouping questions makes the list easier to read and ensures that all aspects within a theme are considered.
**How to do it:** After generating a list of questions, look for questions that are related to the same topic and group them together under a relevant heading.

### Principle 5: Make the Questions Clear and Useful! (Actionable Questions)
Imagine asking a question about the treehouse that is confusing or doesn't help anyone think about safety. This principle means writing questions that are easy to understand and encourage the design team to think specifically about security requirements.

**What is it?** Formulating questions that are clear, concise, and prompt specific consideration of security requirements, controls, or potential vulnerabilities.
**Why it matters:** Questions should guide the design process. Clear and actionable questions help the design team identify and address security needs effectively.
**How to do it:** Write questions using simple language. Make sure each question focuses on a specific security aspect.

### Principle 6: Think About How It Will Be Used in Real Life! (Contextualization)
Imagine designing the treehouse safety features and thinking about how kids will actually play in it. This principle means tailoring the security questions to the specific project and how it will be used in the real world.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the security questions are relevant to the specific project or system being designed, considering its intended use, environment, and potential users.
**Why it matters:** Security needs vary depending on the project. Questions should be tailored to the specific context to be relevant and effective.
**How to do it:** Understand the purpose of the project, who will use it, and where it will be used. Ask security questions that are specific to that context.
