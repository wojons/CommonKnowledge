# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Showing Your Thinking Steps (Solve with Chain of Thought) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Showing Your Thinking Steps (Solve with Chain of Thought) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are trying to solve a tricky math problem, and instead of just writing the answer, you show all the steps you took to figure it out! Showing your thinking steps (Solve with Chain of Thought) is like doing that for any problem or question! It's about explaining your step-by-step reasoning process so others can see *how* you got to your answer.

**What is it?** Chain of Thought (CoT) is a way of thinking and explaining where you show all the intermediate steps you took to reach a final answer or solution. Instead of just giving the result, you explain your reasoning process step-by-step. This pattern involves taking a problem or question and showing your structured thinking process, reflecting on your steps, and then providing the final output. You put your thinking process in a "Thought" section, your review of your thinking in a "Reflection" section, and your final answer in an "Output" section.
**Why it matters?** Showing your thinking steps is helpful for many reasons! It helps you make sure your own reasoning is correct. It helps others understand *how* you got your answer, which can help them learn. It also makes your answer more trustworthy because people can see the logic behind it. It's about making your thinking process clear and transparent! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super thinking explainer and showing your thinking steps!

## Core Goal: Solving Problems by Clearly Showing the Step-by-Step Reasoning Process!
The main point of showing your thinking steps (solve with chain of thought) is to solve problems or answer questions by explicitly showing the step-by-step reasoning process ("chain of thought") in a structured output format, including sections for thought, reflection, and the final output.

**What's the goal?** To take a problem or question and work through it step-by-step, explaining your thinking process as you go. You write down your thoughts in a special section, review your thinking, and then provide the final answer. The goal is to make your reasoning clear and easy for others to follow.
**Why is this the goal?** Because explicitly showing the reasoning process enhances transparency, allows for verification of the logic, and can help identify errors in thinking. By structuring the response to include the step-by-step thought process and reflection, you provide a detailed account of how the solution was reached, which is valuable for learning, debugging, and building trust in the output. It's about making sure that the process of solving a problem is as clear as the solution itself.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Chain of Thought

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to show your thinking steps.

### Principle 1: Show Your Work! (Explicit Reasoning)
Imagine just writing "10" as the answer to a math problem without showing how you added the numbers. This principle means clearly showing the steps taken to reach a conclusion.

**What is it?** Describing the intermediate steps, logical deductions, and reasoning process used to arrive at a final answer or solution.
**Why it matters:** Explicit reasoning makes your thinking process visible and allows others to follow your logic.
**How to do it:** For each step in solving the problem, write down what you are thinking and doing.

### Principle 2: Put Your Thinking in Order! (Structured Thinking)
Imagine your math steps are all over the page! This principle means organizing the reasoning process into logical steps.

**What is it?** Arranging the steps of your reasoning process in a clear and logical sequence.
**Why it matters:** A structured thinking process is easier to follow and understand.
**How to do it:** Break down the problem into smaller parts and think through them one by one in a logical order.

### Principle 3: Look Back at Your Steps! (Reflection)
Imagine finishing the math problem and looking back at your steps to see if you made any mistakes. This principle means reviewing the thinking process to identify potential errors or improvements.

**What is it?** Taking time to review the steps you took in your reasoning process, considering if the logic was sound, if there were alternative approaches, or if any mistakes were made.
**Why it matters:** Reflection helps you verify your reasoning and learn from your thinking process.
**How to do it:** After you have worked through the problem, look back at your steps. Does the logic make sense? Could you have approached it differently?

### Principle 4: Let Others See How You Thought! (Transparency)
Imagine keeping your math steps a secret! This principle means making the reasoning process visible to the user.

**What is it?** Presenting the step-by-step reasoning process, including thoughts and reflections, as part of the final output.
**Why it matters:** Transparency builds trust in the answer and allows others to understand the logic behind it.
**How to do it:** Include sections in your output that show your thinking process and reflections.

### Principle 5: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Output)
Imagine putting your thinking steps in one section, your review in another, and the answer in a third. This principle means presenting the thinking process, reflection, and final output in specific Markdown sections.

**What is it?** Organizing your response into predefined Markdown sections with clear headings for Thought, Reflection, and Output.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes your response easy to read and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the headings Thought, Reflection, and Output to organize your answer.
