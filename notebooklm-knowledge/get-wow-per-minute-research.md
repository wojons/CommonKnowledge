# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Measuring How Exciting Content Is (Get Wow Per Minute) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Measuring How Exciting Content Is (Get Wow Per Minute) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are watching a video, and every minute something surprising or super interesting happens that makes you say, "Wow!" Measuring how exciting content is (Get Wow Per Minute) is like trying to count how many "wow" moments there are in a piece of content for every minute you watch or read it! It's about figuring out how much exciting and valuable stuff is packed into the content.

**What is it?** "Wow-factor" is how surprising, new, insightful (makes you think deeply), valuable (useful), or wise (full of deep knowledge) content is. "Wow Per Minute" (WPM) is a way to measure how often you experience these "wow" moments for every minute of the content. It's like giving a score to content based on how much exciting and valuable information it gives you over time. You look at the content, think about how much surprise, novelty, insight, value, and wisdom it has, give scores for each, and then give an overall "Wow Per Minute" score.
**Why it matters?** There is so much content available today! Measuring how exciting content is can help people decide what to watch or read if they want to find things that are full of interesting ideas and valuable information. It's a way to evaluate how rewarding content is for the viewer or reader. It's about finding the content that gives you the most "aha!" moments and useful knowledge in the shortest amount of time! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super content excitement meter and measuring how exciting content is!

## Core Goal: Quantifying the Excitement and Value in Content Over Time!
The main point of measuring how exciting content is (Get Wow Per Minute) is to analyze input content and quantify its "wow-factor" per minute based on subjective criteria (surprise, novelty, insight, value, wisdom), providing a numerical score and explanations in a specific JSON format.

**What's the goal?** To read or watch content and give it scores (from 0 to 10) for how much surprise, novelty, insight, value, and wisdom it has for every minute. You then combine these scores to give an overall "Wow Per Minute" score and explain why you gave those scores, all in a specific computer format called JSON.
**Why is this the goal?** Because evaluating content based on specific criteria like surprise, novelty, and insight helps to assess its quality and potential impact on the viewer or reader. By attempting to quantify these subjective qualities and presenting them in a structured format, you provide a detailed breakdown of what makes the content engaging and valuable. This is useful for content creators, curators, and consumers who want to understand and compare content based on its potential to deliver impactful "wow" moments. It's about making sure that the excitement and value in content are identified and measured.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Wow-Factor Measurement

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to measure wow-factor.

### Principle 1: What Makes Me Say "Wow"? (Subjective Criteria)
Imagine thinking about what makes content exciting â€“ is it something unexpected, a new idea, or something really useful? This principle means assessing content based on personal perception of "wow-factor" components: surprise, novelty, insight, value, and wisdom.

**What is it?** Evaluating the content based on how much it makes you feel surprised (unexpected), presents new ideas (novelty), makes you think deeply (insight), is practically useful (value), or contains deep knowledge (wisdom).
**Why it matters:** These are the specific qualities that define "wow-factor" in this context. You need to assess the content based on these criteria.
**How to do it:** As you consume the content, pay attention to moments that are surprising, present new ideas, make you think, seem useful, or contain deep knowledge.

### Principle 2: Give It a Number! (Quantification - Subjective)
Imagine giving a score from 0 to 10 for how surprising the content was. This principle means attempting to assign numerical scores to subjective qualities like surprise or insight.

**What is it?** Assigning numerical scores (from 0 to 10) to represent the perceived amount of surprise, novelty, insight, value, and wisdom present in the content, often considered on a per-minute basis.
**Why it matters:** The output requires numerical scores for each criterion and an overall score.
**How to do it:** Based on your subjective assessment (Principle 1), assign a score from 0 to 10 for each "wow-factor" component. A higher score means more of that quality is present.

### Principle 3: Explain Your Scores! (Explanation)
Imagine giving a score of 8 for surprise and needing to explain *why* it was so surprising in a short sentence. This principle means providing concise explanations for the assigned scores.

**What is it?** Writing short sentences (exactly 25 words) that explain the reasoning behind the numerical score given for each "wow-factor" component and the overall WPM score.
**Why it matters:** Explanations help others understand *why* the content received certain scores.
**How to do it:** For each score, write a sentence that explains the amount of that quality per minute and edit it to be exactly 25 words. Do the same for the overall WPM score.

### Principle 4: Put It in the Right Box! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting all the scores and explanations into a specific format with labels like "Summary" and "Novelty_per_minute." This principle means presenting the evaluation and scores in a specific JSON format.

**What is it?** Organizing the summary, scores, and explanations into the predefined fields of a JSON object with the exact keys specified in the output instructions.
**Why it matters:** The output requires a specific JSON format.
**How to do it:** Create a JSON object with all the required keys (Summary, Surprise_per_minute, etc.) and fill in the corresponding values (your summary, scores, and explanations).

### Principle 5: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be only in JSON, but you include extra text outside the JSON! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including being only JSON, using the exact format, and meeting word counts.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including outputting only a JSON object, using the exact format and keys provided, meeting the word count limits for explanations, and not including any other content or complaints.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated output is a valid JSON object with the correct structure and content.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Wow Per Minute Analysis Looks Like (The Checklist!)
