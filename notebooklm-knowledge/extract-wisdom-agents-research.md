# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Smart Ideas with AI Teams (Extracting Wisdom Agents) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Smart Ideas with AI Teams (Extracting Wisdom Agents) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a big project to find all the surprising and interesting ideas in a huge pile of books. Instead of doing it all yourself, you get help from many friends, and each friend looks for a different kind of idea! Finding smart ideas with AI teams is like using different computer helpers (AI agents) to read text and find all sorts of surprising, insightful, and interesting information, working together like a team!

**What is it?** This is a way of thinking about using different computer helpers (AI agents) that are good at different things (like one is good at finding facts, another at finding quotes) to analyze text. They work together in teams, and then a main helper (a generalist agent) puts all their findings together. The goal is to find different types of smart ideas and lessons (wisdom) from the text, like summaries, main ideas, quotes, habits, facts, references, and advice. The output shows the combined findings from the main helpers and a summary of what each team of helpers found.
**Why it matters?** Sometimes, looking at information from just one point of view isn't enough to find all the valuable insights. By using different "agents" with different "perspectives" (like a psychology expert, a technology expert, etc.), you can get a more complete and diverse understanding of the content. This helps uncover more surprising and insightful information than a single helper might find. It's about using teamwork (even with computers!) to find all the hidden wisdom! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super team leader for AI helpers and finding smart ideas together!

## Core Goal: Using AI Teams to Find All Sorts of Valuable Information!
The main point of finding smart ideas with AI teams (extracting wisdom agents) is to simulate a multi-agent AI system analyzing input text for various types of insightful information related to specific topics, presenting the synthesized results and a summary of the agent teams' work in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To use the idea of different computer helpers (AI agents) working together to analyze text and find different kinds of surprising, insightful, and interesting information (like summaries, ideas, quotes, facts, and advice), and then show the combined results from the main helpers and a summary of what each team of helpers found, all in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because complex content often contains various types of valuable information that require different approaches to identify and extract. By simulating a multi-agent system with diverse perspectives, you can ensure a more comprehensive analysis that captures a wider range of insights. Presenting the synthesized results and team summaries provides a structured overview of the extracted wisdom and highlights the value of using different perspectives in analysis. It's about making sure that valuable information is found from multiple angles and presented clearly.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for AI Team Analysis

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to analyze with AI teams.

### Principle 1: Work Together! (Simulated Collaboration)
Imagine your friends working together to find different kinds of ideas in the books. This principle means representing different viewpoints contributing to a collective analysis of the text.

**What is it?** The concept of using multiple AI agents, each with a simulated different perspective or expertise, to analyze the same content and contribute to a shared understanding.
**Why it matters:** Different perspectives can uncover different types of insights. Simulating collaboration helps ensure a more comprehensive analysis.
**How to do it:** Think about how experts from different fields (like psychology, technology, philosophy) would look at the content.

### Principle 2: Put It All Together! (Information Synthesis)
Imagine the main helper collecting all the ideas from the different friends and putting them into one big report. This principle means combining information and perspectives from multiple sources (simulated agents) to form a comprehensive output.

**What is it?** The process of combining the findings from the individual simulated AI agents or teams into a unified and comprehensive output for each category of information.
**Why it matters:** Synthesis ensures that the final output includes insights from all the different perspectives that analyzed the content.
**How to do it:** For each section (ideas, insights, quotes, etc.), combine the findings from the simulated agents into a single list or summary.

### Principle 3: Find Different Kinds of Smart Ideas! (Structured Extraction)
Imagine looking for surprising facts, good advice, and interesting quotes separately. This principle means identifying and categorizing various types of insightful information from the text.

**What is it?** Systematically identifying and extracting different types of valuable information from the input text, such as summaries, ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, and recommendations, and organizing them into predefined categories.
**Why it matters:** The output requires extracting specific types of wisdom.
**How to do it:** Use the provided categories (SUMMARY, IDEAS, INSIGHTS, QUOTES, HABITS, FACTS, REFERENCES, ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY, RECOMMENDATIONS) to guide your extraction.

### Principle 4: Say It Briefly! (Conciseness)
Imagine the helpers have to write their ideas in short sentences, like 15 words. This principle means summarizing complex information and contributions within strict word limits.

**What is it?** Condensing the extracted and synthesized information into concise phrases or sentences that meet the specified word count limits for each output section.
**Why it matters:** Conciseness makes the information easy to read and digest quickly.
**How to do it:** For each item in the output lists or summaries, write it to be the exact word count required (e.g., 15 words).

### Principle 5: Show What Everyone Found! (Transparency - Simulated)
Imagine the report shows the final findings and also briefly mentions what each friend contributed. This principle means showing the synthesized results from the main helpers and summarizing the simulated contributions of the individual agent teams.

**What is it?** Presenting the final output from the "generalist" agents for each category and also providing a summary of the simulated work or findings of the individual "specialist" agents within each team.
**Why it matters:** This provides insight into the simulated analysis process and highlights the value of the different perspectives.
**How to do it:** Output the content of the main sections (SUMMARY, IDEAS, INSIGHTS, etc.) and also include a section summarizing the simulated contributions of each agent team.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the report has to follow many rules, like how long sentences can be or what kind of formatting to use. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including word counts, bullet types, and negative constraints.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including word counts, using bulleted lists, not repeating information, not starting bullets with the same words, using Markdown only, and not including bold or italics or warnings/notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely. Double-check word counts, list lengths, and negative constraints.
