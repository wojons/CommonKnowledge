# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Writing Computer Rules to Find Problems (Write Nuclei Template Rule) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Writing Computer Rules to Find Problems (Write Nuclei Template Rule) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you want to create a special rule for a computer program that helps it find broken locks on bike racks automatically! Writing computer rules to find problems is like doing that for security weaknesses in computer systems! It's about writing special instructions (called a Nuclei template) that tell a computer program how to automatically look for and find security problems! It's about creating rules for finding vulnerabilities.

**What is it?** Nuclei is a computer program that helps find security problems (vulnerabilities) in websites and other computer systems automatically. A Nuclei template is a set of instructions written in a special code language (YAML) that tells Nuclei exactly how to look for a specific security problem. Writing computer rules to find problems means taking information about a security problem and writing the correct Nuclei template code. This code includes instructions for sending messages to a computer system (HTTP requests), looking for specific things in the response (matchers), pulling out important information (extractors), and using information found to do more checks (dynamic data extraction). The goal is to create a rule that helps Nuclei automatically find the security problem.
**Why it matters?** Manually checking for security problems can take a long time! Writing computer rules to find problems helps automate the process, allowing security experts to quickly and efficiently scan many computer systems for known weaknesses. This helps find and fix security problems faster, making computer systems safer. It's about creating automated tools for finding security issues! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super rule writer and writing computer rules to find problems!

## Core Goal: Generating Code Rules to Automatically Detect Security Problems!
The main point of writing computer rules to find problems (write Nuclei template rule) is to analyze cybersecurity vulnerability information and generate a Nuclei YAML template for detecting the vulnerability, utilizing specific Nuclei features.

**What's the goal?** To take information about a security problem and write special code instructions (a Nuclei template) that tell a computer program how to automatically look for that problem. You use specific parts of the Nuclei language to tell it what messages to send, what to look for in the answers, and how to use information it finds.
**Why is this the goal?** Because automating the detection of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is essential for efficient and scalable security testing. By generating Nuclei YAML templates that accurately identify vulnerabilities and leverage specific Nuclei features, you provide security professionals with a powerful tool for automatically scanning systems and finding known weaknesses. This contributes to improving the overall security posture of computer systems. It's about making sure that security problems can be found automatically using code rules.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Rule Writing

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to write rules.

### Principle 1: What's the Problem? (Vulnerability Understanding)
Imagine needing to write a rule to find broken bike locks. You need to understand what a broken lock looks like! This principle means understanding of the cybersecurity vulnerability to be detected.

**What is it?** Having a clear understanding of the security problem you are trying to find with your rule, including how it works and what signs it leaves behind.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the vulnerability to write a rule that can accurately find it.
**How to do it:** Read information about the vulnerability. How does it work? What does it affect?

### Principle 2: Know the Rule Language! (Nuclei Knowledge)
Imagine needing to write a rule for a computer program, but you don't know the language it understands! This principle means having knowledge of Nuclei template syntax, components (HTTP requests, matchers, extractors), and features.

**What is it?** Understanding the specific code language (YAML) and the different parts (components) that are used to write rules for the Nuclei program.
**Why it matters:** You need to know the Nuclei language to write correct rules.
**How to do it:** Learn about the different parts of a Nuclei template, like how to tell it to send a message (HTTP request) or how to tell it what to look for in the answer (matchers).

### Principle 3: How Can the Computer Find It? (Detection Logic)
Imagine writing a rule that tells the computer to look for red things, but the broken lock isn't red! This principle means designing the template to accurately identify the vulnerability based on its characteristics.

**What is it?** Figuring out the specific steps and checks that the Nuclei program needs to perform to accurately find the vulnerability.
**Why it matters:** The rule needs to be able to find the vulnerability reliably without finding things that are not actually problems (false positives).
**How to do it:** Based on how the vulnerability works, what specific messages should Nuclei send? What should it look for in the response to know the problem exists?

### Principle 4: Use the Right Code Words! (Syntax Adherence)
Imagine using the wrong command in the rule language, and the computer doesn't understand! This principle means generating YAML code that follows the correct grammatical rules of the YAML language and Nuclei template specifications.

**What is it?** Writing the Nuclei template code using the correct YAML syntax and following the specific rules for how Nuclei templates are written.
**Why it matters:** If the code has syntax errors, the Nuclei program cannot use the rule.
**How to do it:** Learn the correct YAML syntax and the specific way to write commands in Nuclei templates.

### Principle 5: Just Show the Code! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the rule code, but you include extra notes! This principle means outputting only the generated Nuclei YAML template without additional commentary.

**What is it?** Presenting only the generated Nuclei YAML template code as the final output, without including any warnings, notes, or other commentary.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a clean block of code that can be used directly by the Nuclei program.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the Nuclei YAML template code and nothing else.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be correct rule code, but it has mistakes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including generating syntactically correct Nuclei YAML templates for detecting vulnerabilities.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including generating a Nuclei YAML template that is syntactically correct and designed to detect the vulnerability.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
