# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Extracting and Formatting Predictions (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Extracting and Formatting Predictions and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a story where someone says what they think will happen in the future, like "I predict it will rain tomorrow!" Extracting and formatting predictions is like finding those sentences in a piece of writing and putting them into a special box with details about when the prediction is supposed to happen and how sure the person is about it. It's about pulling out ideas about the future and organizing them clearly.

**What is it?** A prediction is a statement about what someone thinks will happen in the future. Extracting predictions means reading a piece of writing and finding all the sentences or phrases that are predictions. Formatting predictions means organizing these predictions and any details about them (like the date the prediction is for, how confident the person is, or how we will know if it's true) into a specific structure, often like a special box or block of text that can be put into a blog post or report.
**Why it matters?** Predictions can be interesting to track and see if they come true! By extracting and formatting predictions, you can easily collect all the ideas about the future from a piece of writing and present them clearly. This helps people see what predictions were made and the details associated with them. It's about organizing ideas about the future so they are easy to see and track! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super future idea collector and organizing predictions clearly!

## Core Goal: Finding and Organizing Ideas About the Future!
The main point of extracting and formatting predictions is to identify statements about the future in input text and present them in a structured format, including specific details about each prediction.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find all the predictions made within it, and then format each prediction into a structured block of text (like a Markdown block for a blog post) that includes the prediction itself and details about when it's expected, how confident the person is, and how we'll know if it's true.
**Why is this the goal?** Because predictions are often scattered throughout a text, and it can be difficult to find and track them. By extracting predictions and organizing them into a structured format, you make it easy to see all the predictions in one place and understand the details associated with each one. This is useful for analyzing trends in predictions, tracking their accuracy over time, and highlighting future-oriented ideas. It's about making sure that ideas about the future are clearly presented and easy to follow.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Prediction Hunting

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find predictions.

### Principle 1: Find Sentences About the Future! (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading a story and looking for sentences that say what someone thinks will happen next. This principle means identifying statements in the text that are predictions about future events or outcomes.

**What is it?** Reading the input text and accurately identifying statements or phrases that express a belief or statement about something that will happen in the future.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the actual predictions in the text to include them in the output.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for phrases like "I predict," "will happen," "is likely to," or descriptions of future events.

### Principle 2: Find the Details About the Future Idea! (Detail Identification)
Imagine the prediction is "It will rain tomorrow!" The detail is "tomorrow." This principle means recognizing specific details associated with each prediction, like the date or how sure the person is.

**What is it?** Identifying specific details associated with each extracted prediction, such as the predicted date or timeframe, the stated level of confidence in the prediction, and the method by which the prediction will be verified or proven true or false.
**Why it matters:** These details provide important context for the prediction.
**How to do it:** For each prediction you find, look for mentions of a specific date or time, words that indicate how confident the person is (like "likely" or "certain"), or how we will know if the prediction came true.

### Principle 3: Put It in a Special Box! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine putting each prediction and its details into a special box in your report. This principle means organizing the extracted predictions and their details into a predefined Markdown block structure.

**What is it?** Arranging the extracted prediction and its associated details into a specific Markdown format, often using headings, labels, or lists within a block, suitable for inclusion in a document like a blog post.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the predictions easy to read and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the specified Markdown structure for the prediction block. Include clear labels for the prediction itself and its details (date, confidence, verification).

### Principle 4: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the report about predictions adds details that weren't in the original story! This principle means reporting the predictions and their details as presented in the input text, without adding your own ideas or interpretations.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted predictions and their associated details exactly as they are described in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external information.
**Why it matters:** The prediction block should accurately reflect the predictions made in the original text.
**How to do it:** Only include the predictions and details that were present in the input text.

### Principle 5: Make It Accurate! (Accuracy)
Imagine the report about predictions gets the date of the prediction wrong! This principle means ensuring the extracted predictions and details are correct.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the predictions and their associated details (date, confidence, verification) are accurately extracted and represented in the output.
**Why it matters:** The prediction block should contain correct information from the original text.
**How to do it:** Double-check that the predictions and details you extracted are accurate compared to the original input text.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Prediction Blocks Look Like (The Checklist!)
