# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Jokes (Extracting Jokes) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Jokes (Extracting Jokes) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are reading something, and you see a part that is supposed to be funny! Finding jokes is like reading text and finding the parts that are meant to make you laugh! It's about spotting the jokes in what you read and pulling them out.

**What is it?** A joke is something said or written that is intended to be funny, usually with a setup and a punchline. Extracting jokes means reading text and identifying the parts that are jokes. You find the part that sets up the joke and the part that is the funny ending (the punchline). You then write down the joke setup and the punchline as separate items in a list.
**Why it matters?** Jokes are a form of communication and entertainment! By finding and extracting jokes from text, you can create a collection of funny content. This can be useful for sharing with others, studying humor, or simply having a list of jokes to make people laugh. It's about finding the funny parts! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super joke finder and extracting jokes from text!

## Core Goal: Finding Jokes and Their Punchlines in Text!
The main point of finding jokes (extracting jokes) is to analyze input text, identify jokes, and extract each joke and its punchline, presenting them as separate bullet points in a Markdown list.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find the parts that are jokes, and for each joke, find the part that sets it up and the funny ending (the punchline), and then put the setup as one bullet point and the punchline as a separate bullet point right after it in a list in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because jokes have a specific structure (setup and punchline), and extracting both components separately helps preserve the joke's format and makes it easy to read and share. By identifying and extracting jokes from text, you create a curated list of humorous content that can be easily accessed and utilized. It's about making sure that the funny parts of a text are clearly identified and presented in a usable format.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Joke Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find jokes.

### Principle 1: What's Supposed to Be Funny? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading text and looking for parts that are intended to make you laugh. This principle means understanding the input text to identify content that is intended to be humorous.

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to identify sections or phrases that are intended to be jokes or humorous.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the jokes in the text to extract them.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for content that seems like a joke or is meant to be funny.

### Principle 2: Where's the Setup and the Funny Part? (Joke Structure Recognition)
Imagine reading a joke and figuring out which part is the beginning and which part is the punchline. This principle means identifying the setup and punchline components of a joke.

**What is it?** For each identified joke, distinguishing between the part that sets up the joke and the part that delivers the funny ending (the punchline).
**Why it matters:** Jokes have a specific structure, and extracting both parts separately is necessary for the output format.
**How to do it:** Read the joke and figure out where the setup ends and the punchline begins.

### Principle 3: Pull Out the Words! (Extraction)
Imagine copying the words of the joke setup and the words of the punchline. This principle means accurately pulling out the joke and its punchline from the text.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the exact wording of the joke setup and the punchline from the input text.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct words for the jokes.
**How to do it:** Copy the text of the joke setup and the text of the punchline accurately.

### Principle 4: Put Them in Separate Lines! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the joke setup and punchline are on the same line in the list! This principle means presenting the joke and punchline as separate bullet points.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted joke setup as one bullet point and the extracted punchline as a separate bullet point immediately following it in a Markdown list.
**Why it matters:** This follows the specified output format and preserves the joke's structure.
**How to do it:** Use a bullet point for the joke setup and a new bullet point for the punchline right after it.

### Principle 5: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of jokes includes a joke you just thought of that wasn't in the text! This principle means identifying jokes as presented in the input, without adding personal judgment on whether they are funny.

**What is it?** Identifying jokes based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions on whether the joke is actually funny or not.
**Why it matters:** The output should reflect the jokes present in the input, regardless of personal humor preferences.
**How to do it:** Focus on identifying content that is intended to be a joke, as indicated by the text.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of jokes is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your list of jokes and punchlines using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
