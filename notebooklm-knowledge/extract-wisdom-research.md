# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Smart Ideas and Lessons (Extracting Wisdom) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Smart Ideas and Lessons (Extracting Wisdom) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read something, and it makes you think about life in a new way, or gives you a surprising fact, or a really good piece of advice! Finding smart ideas and lessons (extracting wisdom) is like reading text and finding all the surprising, insightful, and interesting information that helps you understand the world better! It's about pulling out the "wisdom" from content.

**What is it?** Wisdom is like having deep understanding and good judgment. Extracting wisdom means reading a piece of writing (like an article, book, or transcript) and identifying different types of information that are surprising, insightful (make you think deeply), or interesting. This includes main ideas, deeper insights, memorable quotes, helpful habits of people mentioned, interesting facts, references to other works, and recommendations for what to do. You look for this information, summarize it briefly, and put it into different sections.
**Why it matters?** In a world with lots of information, it's valuable to find the parts that are truly insightful and can help you learn and grow. By finding and extracting wisdom, you can quickly identify the most important ideas, lessons, and advice from content. This is useful for learning new things, changing how you think, or finding inspiration. It's about finding the valuable nuggets of knowledge! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super wisdom miner and finding smart ideas and lessons!

## Core Goal: Finding Valuable Insights and Information in Content!
The main point of finding smart ideas and lessons (extracting wisdom) is to analyze input text on specific topics and extract various types of surprising, insightful, and interesting information, providing a structured output with summaries, lists of ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, and recommendations, adhering to strict formatting and word count constraints.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text about topics like life, people, technology, or learning, and find different kinds of information that are surprising, make you think deeply, or are interesting. You then put these ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, and recommendations into different sections, making sure each item is short (like 16 words) and there are a certain number of items in each list, all in Markdown without bold or italics or warnings.
**Why is this the goal?** Because content often contains valuable information that can broaden understanding, provide new perspectives, and offer practical guidance. By systematically extracting various types of insightful information (ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, recommendations) and presenting them in a structured format, you help users quickly identify the most valuable takeaways from the content. This facilitates learning, reflection, and the application of knowledge. It's about making sure that the most insightful and interesting information is clearly identified, categorized, and presented in a way that is easy to digest and use.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Wisdom Mining

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find wisdom.

### Principle 1: What's in the Text? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading text and looking for different kinds of valuable information. This principle means understanding the input text and its relevance to the specified topics (like life, AI, learning).

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to understand its content and identify information that is surprising, insightful, or interesting, especially related to topics like human flourishing, AI, learning, etc.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text and the topics to find the wisdom.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. What is it about? Does it talk about any of the specified topics?

### Principle 2: What Kind of Smart Idea Is It? (Information Identification)
Imagine finding a surprising fact, a good piece of advice, and a deep thought. This principle means recognizing different types of insightful information (ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, recommendations).

**What is it?** Identifying and distinguishing between different types of valuable information presented in the text, such as main ideas, deeper insights, direct quotes, personal habits mentioned, factual statements, references to other works, and suggestions for action.
**Why it matters:** The output requires extracting and categorizing different types of wisdom.
**How to do it:** As you read, ask: Is this a main idea? Is it a quote? Is it a fact? Is it advice?

### Principle 3: Pull Out the Words! (Extraction)
Imagine copying the words that describe the smart ideas or facts from the text. This principle means accurately pulling out the descriptions of the information.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the descriptions of the different types of surprising, insightful, and interesting information from the input text.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct words for the information.
**How to do it:** Copy the text that describes the ideas, quotes, facts, etc., accurately.

### Principle 4: Say It Briefly! (Information Condensation)
Imagine a smart idea is explained in a long paragraph, but you need to write it in just 16 words! This principle means summarizing information to fit strict word limits.

**What is it?** Condensing the extracted information (ideas, insights, habits, facts, recommendations) into concise phrases or sentences that meet the specified word count limits (e.g., exactly 16 words for ideas, insights, habits, facts, recommendations; 25 words for the summary sentence; 15 words for the takeaway sentence).
**Why it matters:** The output requires concise summaries and bullets with specific word counts.
**How to do it:** For each item, write a short summary and edit it to be the exact word count required for that section.

### Principle 5: Put It in the Right Box! (Categorization)
Imagine putting all the surprising facts in one box, and all the good advice in another. This principle means grouping extracted information into predefined types and presenting them in specific sections.

**What is it?** Organizing the extracted information into the specified Markdown sections with the correct headings (SUMMARY, IDEAS, INSIGHTS, QUOTES, HABITS, FACTS, REFERENCES, ONE-SENTENCE TAKEAWAY, RECOMMENDATIONS).
**Why it matters:** The output requires presenting different types of wisdom in distinct sections.
**How to do it:** Use the provided headings to place each piece of extracted information in its correct section.

### Principle 6: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of facts includes something you believe is true, but it wasn't in the text! This principle means reporting the information as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted information based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external information not mentioned in the text.
**Why it matters:** The extracted wisdom should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the information that is actually in the input text.

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules, like using bold text or repeating bullet beginnings. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including word counts, minimum quantities, bullet types, and negative constraints.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including word counts, minimum number of items for lists, using bulleted lists, not repeating information, not starting bullets with the same words, using Markdown only, and not including warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely. Double-check word counts, list lengths, and negative constraints.
