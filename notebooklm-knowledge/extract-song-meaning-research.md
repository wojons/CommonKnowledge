## Introduction: What is Figuring Out What Songs Mean (Extracting Song Meaning) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you hear a song, and the words make you think about a certain feeling or a story! Figuring out what songs mean (extracting song meaning) is like listening to the words of a song and trying to understand the message, feeling, or story that the songwriter is trying to share! It's about being a detective for song lyrics.

**What is it?** Song lyrics are the words of a song. The meaning of a song is the message, feeling, or story that the songwriter wants to express. Figuring out the meaning means listening to or reading the lyrics and trying to understand what they are about. You might also look at what the songwriter has said about the song or what other people think it means. You then write a short summary of what you think the song means and show parts of the lyrics or other information that support your idea.
**Why it matters?** Songs can make us feel emotions, tell us stories, or make us think about things in new ways! By understanding what a song means, you can connect with the music on a deeper level and appreciate the songwriter's message. It's about unlocking the story or feeling hidden in the music! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super song detective and figuring out what songs mean!

## Core Goal: Understanding the Message or Story in a Song!
The main point of figuring out what songs mean (extracting song meaning) is to analyze a song to provide a summary of its meaning, supported by detailed evidence from lyrics, artist commentary, and fan analysis.

**What's the goal?** To listen to or read the words of a song and any information about what the songwriter or other people say it means, and then write a short summary of what you think the song is about, showing parts of the lyrics or other information that help explain your idea, all in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because songs are a form of artistic expression that often convey messages, emotions, or stories through lyrics and music. By analyzing the lyrics and any available context (like artist interviews or fan discussions), you can gain a deeper understanding of the song's intended meaning or how it resonates with listeners. Providing a summary supported by evidence helps justify the interpretation and makes the analysis more convincing. It's about making sure that the meaning you find in a song is supported by what the song says or what others say about it.
