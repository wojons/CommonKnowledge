Imagine you watched a cool video online, and you want to quickly tell someone the most important things that were said and when they were said in the video! Summarizing online videos is like doing that for videos on websites like YouTube!

**What is it?** A YouTube video is an online video. Summarizing a YouTube video means watching the video or reading a written record of what was said (a transcript) and creating a shorter version that includes the most important information. This pattern involves finding the main ideas or key points that were discussed in the video and noting the specific time (timestamp) in the video when each key point was mentioned.

Summarizing online videos helps you quickly get the most important ideas and know exactly when they were talked about in the video. This is useful for deciding if you want to watch the whole video, finding specific parts you want to see again, or sharing the key information with others. It's about getting the highlights from a video! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super video reporter and summarizing online videos!
