# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Command Line Commands (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Command Line Commands and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a special tool on your computer that you can control by typing words, like a magic wand! Command line commands are the specific words and instructions you type to tell that tool what to do. Creating command line commands is like learning the secret spells for your magic wand by reading the instructions that came with it. It's about figuring out the right words to make a computer tool do what you want, using only the options the instructions say you can use.

**What is it?** A command line interface (CLI) is a way to control a computer program by typing commands instead of clicking buttons. A command line command is the specific instruction you type (like `copy file.txt new_location`). Creating a command means figuring out the correct words, options (switches), and details you need to type to make a specific tool do a task, based on the instructions (documentation) for that tool. You must *only* use the options that are written in the instructions, and you put in the specific details you want (like the file name).
**Why it matters?** Command line tools are very powerful for doing many tasks on a computer, especially for things like managing files, running programs, or automating tasks. Knowing how to create commands helps you use these powerful tools effectively. By relying only on the tool's instructions, you make sure your commands are correct and will work properly. It's about learning the precise language to control computer tools! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super command creator and using computer tools with the right instructions!

## Core Goal: Generating Correct Instructions for Computer Tools!
The main point of creating command line commands is to generate the exact words and options needed to make a specific computer tool perform a task, using only the instructions provided for that tool.

**What's the goal?** To take a request for a task to be done by a command line tool and the instructions (documentation) for that tool, and generate the correct command with the right options and details, using *only* the options that are explicitly listed in the provided instructions.
**Why is this the goal?** Because command line tools require precise instructions. Using incorrect options or syntax will cause the command to fail. By relying strictly on the provided documentation, you ensure that the generated command is valid and will work as intended, allowing users to control the tool effectively and safely. It's about translating a task request into the exact language the computer tool understands, based on its manual.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Command Creation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create commands well.

### Principle 1: Only Use What the Instructions Say! (Documentation Adherence)
Imagine the magic wand instructions say you can only say "wave" or "sparkle." You shouldn't try saying "fly"! This principle means strictly using only the options and switches that are explicitly written in the help documentation for the tool.

**What is it?** Relying solely on the provided help documentation as the authoritative source for available commands, options (switches), and syntax, and using *only* those explicitly listed.
**Why it matters:** The documentation tells you exactly how to use the tool. Using options not in the documentation will likely cause the command to fail or do something unexpected.
**How to do it:** Read the documentation carefully. When you need an option, find it in the documentation. Do not guess or assume options exist.

### Principle 2: Be Exactly Right! (Precision)
Imagine trying to tell the magic wand to "wave" but you say "wve." It wouldn't work! This principle means generating the command with the exact correct words, options, and syntax.

**What is it?** Generating a command that uses the correct command name, options, switches, and syntax exactly as described in the documentation, and inserting the user's requested details accurately.
**Why it matters:** Command line tools are very sensitive to syntax. Even small mistakes will cause the command to fail.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to the spelling and formatting of commands and options in the documentation. Make sure you type them exactly right. Insert the user's details (like file names or numbers) in the correct places in the command.

### Principle 3: Make It Work! (Safety - Implied)
Imagine creating a spell for the magic wand that makes it explode! This principle means generating commands that are valid and will run properly without causing harm or errors.

**What is it?** Generating commands that are syntactically correct and use valid options as defined in the documentation, ensuring they can be executed by the command line tool.
**Why it matters:** Commands should perform the intended task safely and reliably. Using incorrect options or syntax can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
**How to do it:** By strictly adhering to the documentation (Principle 1!) and ensuring precision (Principle 2!), you increase the likelihood that the command will be valid and run properly.

### Principle 4: Find the Right Instructions! (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading the magic wand instructions and needing to find the part about making it sparkle. This principle means identifying the relevant options and switches in the documentation based on the task the user wants to perform.

**What is it?** Reading the user's request and the provided help documentation to identify which specific command, options, and switches are needed to perform the requested task.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the correct instructions in the documentation to build the command that fulfills the user's request.
**How to do it:** Read the user's prompt. What task do they want to do? Then scan the documentation for options or commands that relate to that task.

### Principle 5: Put the Details in the Right Place! (Parameter Insertion)
Imagine telling the magic wand to "sparkle red" but you say "red sparkle." The order might matter! This principle means correctly inserting the specific details the user wants (like file names, numbers, or settings) into the command in the correct location.

**What is it?** Accurately placing the user-provided details (which act as parameters or arguments for the command) into the correct positions within the generated command string, as specified by the documentation.
**Why it matters:** The location of parameters in a command is often important for the tool to interpret them correctly.
**How to do it:** Look at the documentation to see where the parameters should go in the command relative to the command name and options. Insert the user's details in those exact spots.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Command Creation Looks Like (The Checklist!)

Here's how you can check if your command creating is super good!

### You Only Used What the Instructions Said (Documentation Adherence)
**What it means:** You only used options and switches that were explicitly listed in the provided help documentation.
**Why it matters:** Relying on documentation ensures the command is valid.

### It Was Exactly Right (Precision)
**What it means:** The command you generated had the correct words, options, and syntax.
**Why it matters:** Precision is crucial for commands to run properly.

### It Will Work (Safety)
**What it means:** The command is valid and should run without errors based on the documentation.
**Why it matters:** Commands should perform the intended task reliably.

### You Found the Right Instructions (Information Extraction)
**What it means:** You identified the correct options and switches in the documentation based on the user's request.

**Why it matters:** Correct parameter placement is important for the tool to understand the command.

### You Followed All the Rules for Showing It (Correct Format)
**What it means:** Your output is only the command itself, without any extra text or formatting.
**Why it matters:** Following the format makes the command ready to use.

## Best Practices: Your Toolkit for Creating Commands

These are like the special tools you can use to be an amazing command creator.

### Read the User's Request
**What it is:** Carefully analyzing what the user wants the command line tool to do and any specific details they want to include.
**Why it's a best practice:** You need to understand the user's goal to generate the correct command.
**How to do it:** Read the user's prompt. What task are they asking for? What information are they providing (like file names, numbers)?

### Read the Tool's Instructions
**What it is:** Thoroughly reading the provided help documentation for the command line tool.
**Why it's a best practice:** The documentation is your primary source of truth for how to use the tool.
**How to do it:** Read through the documentation. Look for the main command name and a list of available options and switches with their descriptions.

### Find the Right Options
**What it is:** Identifying the specific options or switches in the documentation that correspond to the task and details in the user's request.
**Why it's a best practice:** You need to find the correct options to build the command that fulfills the request.
**How to do it:** Based on the user's request, scan the documentation for options that perform that action or accept the type of details the user provided.

### Build the Command
**What it is:** Putting together the command name, the identified options and switches, and the user's details in the correct order and syntax.
**Why it's a best practice:** This is the process of constructing the command.
**How to do it:** Start with the command name. Add the options and switches you found. Insert the user's details in the places indicated by the documentation.

### Only Use Documented Options
**What it is:** Double-checking that every option and switch you included in the command is explicitly listed in the provided help documentation.
**Why it is a best practice:** This is a critical rule to ensure the command is valid and uses supported features.
**How to do it:** For each option or switch in your generated command, find it in the provided documentation. If it's not there, remove it.

### Put User Details in the Right Spot
**What it is:** Ensuring that any file names, numbers, or other specific information from the user are placed in the correct location within the command string, as shown in the documentation.
**Why it's a best practice:** The tool needs parameters in the right place to work correctly.
**How to do it:** Look at the documentation's examples or descriptions of options to see where the parameters should go.

### Output Only the Command
**What it is:** Presenting only the final bash command as the output, without any extra text, explanations, warnings, or formatting like Markdown.
**Why it's a best practice:** The output should be the clean, executable command.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the command string itself.

### Follow All Output Instructions
**What it is:** Adhering strictly to all the rules for the output format, including not outputting warnings or notes, and not using Markdown.
**Why it's a best practice:** Following all instructions ensures the output is in the correct format and meets all requirements.
**How to do it:** Review the output instructions before generating the final output and make sure you have followed every single one.

## Common Pitfalls: Traps to Watch Out For in Creating Commands

These are like holes in the path that can make your command creation wrong!

### Using Options Not in Instructions (Undocumented Options)
**What it is:** Including options or switches in the command that are not explicitly listed in the provided help documentation.
**Why it's a pitfall:** The command will likely fail or behave unexpectedly.
**How to avoid:** Only use documented options (Principle 1 & Best Practice 5!).

### Getting the Command Wrong (Incorrect Syntax)
**What it is:** Making mistakes in the spelling, order, or syntax of the command or its options.
**Why it's a pitfall:** The command will not run.
**How to avoid:** Be precise (Principle 2!). Build the command carefully (Best Practice 4!).

### Putting Details in the Wrong Place (Incorrect Parameter Insertion)
**What it is:** Inserting the user's file names, numbers, or other details in the wrong location within the command.
**Why it's a pitfall:** The tool will not interpret the command correctly.
**How to avoid:** Put user details in the right spot (Principle 5 & Best Practice 6!).

### Outputting Extra Stuff (Including Warnings/Notes/Formatting)
**What it is:** Including warnings, notes, explanations, or formatting like Markdown along with the command.
**Why it's a pitfall:** The output should only be the command.
**How to avoid:** Output only the command and follow all output instructions (Best Practice 7 & 8!).

### Guessing at Options
**What it is:** Trying to guess what an option or switch might be instead of finding it in the documentation.
**Why it's a pitfall:** Guessing is likely to lead to using incorrect or undocumented options.
**How to avoid:** Use the documentation as your primary source of truth (Principle 1!). Do not guess.

### Not Understanding the Request
**What it is:** Misunderstanding what the user wants the command to do.
**Why it's a pitfall:** You will generate a command that does not fulfill the user's request.
**How to avoid:** Read the user's request carefully (Best Practice 1!).
