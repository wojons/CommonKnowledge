# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding the Special Video Code (Extracting Video ID) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding the Special Video Code (Extracting Video ID) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine every video online has a secret code that is like its fingerprint â€“ it's unique to that video! Finding the special video code (extracting video ID) is like looking at a website address (a URL) for a video and finding that secret code hidden inside it! It's about pulling out the unique identifier for a video.

**What is it?** A URL is a website address. A video ID is a unique string of letters and numbers that identifies a specific video on a platform like YouTube. Extracting the video ID means looking at the URL of a video and finding the part of the address that is the video's unique code. You then present only that code as the output.
**Why it matters?** Video IDs are important for computers and websites to know exactly which video you want to watch! By extracting the video ID, you get the direct identifier for the video, which can be used by other programs or tools. It's like getting the key that unlocks that specific video! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super code finder and getting the special video code!

## Core Goal: Finding the Unique Identifier for a Video from Its Website Address!
The main point of finding the special video code (extracting video ID) is to analyze a URL and extract the video ID, outputting only the ID as plain text.

**What's the goal?** To look at a website address (URL) for a video and find the unique code that identifies that video, and then output only that code by itself, without anything else included, and without any warnings or notes.
**Why is this the goal?** Because video IDs are the unique identifiers for videos on platforms like YouTube. By extracting the video ID from a URL, you isolate the specific code that points directly to that video, which is valuable for various technical applications, sharing, or analysis. It's about making sure that the unique identifier for a video is easily extractable from its link.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Video Code Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find video codes.

### Principle 1: What's the Address? (URL Analysis)
Imagine looking at a website address like www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ. This principle means understanding the structure of website addresses (URLs) and how video IDs are typically included in them.

**What is it?** Examining the input URL to understand its different parts and where the video ID is usually located within the address.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the URL structure to find the video ID.
**How to do it:** Look at the different parts of the URL (like the domain name, the path, and any parameters after a question mark). Where do video platforms usually put the video's unique code?

### Principle 2: Where's the Special Code? (Information Extraction)
Imagine looking at the YouTube address and seeing "v=dQw4w9WgXcQ". The part after "v=" is the code! This principle means accurately pulling out the specific string of characters that represents the video ID.

**What is it?** Identifying and accurately extracting the unique string of letters and numbers within the URL that serves as the video's identifier.
**Why it matters:** This is the specific code you need to extract.
**How to do it:** Based on the URL structure, find the part that is the video ID and copy it exactly.

### Principle 3: Only Show the Code! (Format Adherence)
Imagine the output includes the website address *and* the video ID. This principle means outputting only the extracted video ID without any extra characters, text, or formatting.

**What is it?** Presenting only the extracted video ID as the final output, with nothing else included.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a clean, ready-to-use video ID.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the extracted video ID string. Do not add any labels, bullet points, or extra text.

### Principle 4: Just Use What the Link Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the output is a video ID for a different video than the one in the link! This principle means basing the extraction solely on the input URL.

**What is it?** Extracting the video ID based solely on the content provided in the input URL, without injecting personal opinions or external video IDs.
**Why it matters:** The extracted video ID should accurately reflect the original URL.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the video ID that is actually present in the input URL.

### Principle 5: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the code, but you add a warning message! This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like not including warnings or notes.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including outputting only the video ID and not including any warnings, errors, or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use as intended.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the extracted video ID and no other text.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Video Codes Look Like (The Checklist!)

Here's how you can check if your video code finding is super good!
