# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Summarizing Code Change Groups (Summarize Pull Requests) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Summarizing Code Change Groups (Summarize Pull Requests) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you and your friends are building a big LEGO project, and someone finishes adding a new room to the house. They put all the changes for that room together in one group (a pull request) and want to tell everyone what they did! Summarizing code change groups is like looking at a group of changes made to computer code (a pull request) and explaining in a short, clear way what was added or changed! It's about summarizing specific sets of code modifications.

**What is it?** In computer programming, when someone makes changes to code, they often group related changes together into something called a "pull request." A pull request is like a suggestion to add those changes to the main project. Summarizing pull requests means looking at the changes in a pull request and creating a short summary of what was done. You also identify the most important pull requests and describe the changes in them in a way that's easy for anyone to understand, even if they don't know all the technical details.
**Why it matters?** Pull requests are how teams review and discuss code changes before they are added to the main project. Summarizing pull requests helps everyone quickly understand what changes are being suggested and why, which is important for code reviews and collaboration. It's about making sure that groups of code changes are easy to understand and discuss! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super code change group reporter and summarizing code change groups!

## Core Goal: Explaining Groups of Code Changes Clearly and Briefly!
The main point of summarizing code change groups (summarize pull requests) is to summarize pull requests for a coding project by providing a summary and listing the top PRs with human-readable descriptions.

**What's the goal?** To look at groups of changes made to computer code (pull requests) and create a short summary of what they are about. You also find the most important pull requests and describe the changes in them in a way that's easy for people to understand.
**Why is this the goal?** Because understanding the purpose and content of pull requests is essential for effective code reviews, collaboration, and project management. By providing a concise summary of pull requests and human-readable descriptions of the most important ones, you facilitate communication among developers and ensure that everyone can quickly grasp the nature and significance of proposed code modifications. It's about making sure that groups of changes to computer code are easy to understand and discuss.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Pull Request Summarization

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to summarize pull requests.

### Principle 1: What Was Changed in This Group? (Information Extraction)
Imagine looking at the group of LEGO changes for the new room and figuring out what was added or changed. This principle means identifying key information from pull requests.

**What is it?** Examining the content of pull requests to identify the main purpose, the specific code changes made, and any related information.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the changes in the pull request to summarize them accurately.
**How to do it:** Read the description of the pull request and look at the code changes included in it.

### Principle 2: Make It Short! (Summarization)
Imagine explaining what was changed in the new LEGO room in just a few sentences. This principle means condensing pull request information into a concise overview.

**What is it?** Creating a brief summary that captures the main purpose and key changes of the pull requests.
**Why it matters:** Concise summaries help people quickly understand what the pull requests are about.
**How to do it:** Write a short overview that explains the main points of the pull requests.

### Principle 3: Explain It Simply! (Clarity)
Imagine describing the LEGO changes using complicated words that your friends don't understand. This principle means providing human-readable descriptions for technical changes (PRs).

**What is it?** Writing descriptions of the changes in the pull requests in a way that is easy for anyone to understand, even if they are not experts in that specific part of the code.
**Why it matters:** Human-readable descriptions help everyone on the team understand what was changed without having to read the code themselves.
**How to do it:** For each pull request, explain in simple terms what problem it solved or what new feature it added.

### Principle 4: Focus on the Best Groups! (Relevance)
Imagine there are many groups of LEGO changes, but only a few are for the most important new rooms. This principle means focusing on top pull requests.

**What is it?** Selecting the most important or impactful pull requests to include in your list.
**Why it matters:** Highlighting top pull requests helps people focus on the most significant groups of changes.
**How to do it:** Consider the size, complexity, or importance of different pull requests.

### Principle 5: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting the summary in one section and the list of important change groups in another. This principle means presenting the summary and PRs in a specific format.

**What is it?** Organizing the summary of pull requests and the list of top pull requests with their descriptions into predefined Markdown sections with clear headings.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the pull request summary easy to read and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the provided headings for the summary and the list of pull requests.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including using Markdown and the specified sections.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and presenting the summary and list of pull requests in the specified sections.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
