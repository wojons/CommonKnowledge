# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Looking at Ideas from Different Angles (Identify DSRP Perspectives) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Looking at Ideas from Different Angles (Identify DSRP Perspectives) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are looking at a house. You can look at it from the front, from the side, from the back, or even from above! Each way you look gives you a different view. Looking at ideas from different angles (identify DSRP perspectives) is like doing that for concepts or topics! It's about seeing how things look and feel when you think about them from different viewpoints. This is a key part of a way of thinking called "systems thinking," which helps us understand how things are connected.

**What is it?** A perspective is like a viewpoint or a way of looking at something. When you take a perspective, you are looking at a "thing" from a specific "point." For example, if you are a student, you have a student's perspective on school rules. If you are a teacher, you have a teacher's perspective. Finding perspectives means looking at a topic or a system (like the school) and figuring out all the different viewpoints that are relevant, like the perspective of a student, a teacher, a parent, or the principal. Each perspective will see different things and have different concerns.
**Why it matters?** The perspective you take completely changes how you see and understand something! If you only look at the house from the front, you won't know what the back looks like. If you only think about school rules from a student's perspective, you won't understand why the teachers or principal made those rules. By looking at ideas from different angles, you can get a more complete and balanced understanding of a topic or system. It helps you see things you might have missed and understand why different people have different opinions. It's about seeing the whole picture by looking from many viewpoints! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super viewpoint explorer and looking at ideas from different angles!

## Core Goal: Exploring Different Viewpoints to Understand a Topic or System More Completely!
The main point of looking at ideas from different angles (identify DSRP perspectives) is to explore the key perspectives surrounding the system. Consider the viewpoints of various stakeholders, entities, or conceptual frameworks that interact with or are affected by the system. Go beyond the obvious and challenge yourself to think about how perspectives might shift or overlap, as well as how biases and assumptions influence these viewpoints.

**What's the goal?** To look at a topic or a system (like a school or a project) and figure out all the different ways people or groups see it (perspectives). You think about who has each viewpoint, what they care about, and how their view affects the system. You also think about how these viewpoints might change or interact and if there are any hidden viewpoints. The goal is to explore these different angles to understand the topic or system more completely.
**Why is this the goal?** Because every perspective offers a unique view of a topic or system, highlighting certain aspects while obscuring others. By actively exploring multiple perspectives, you can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the subject matter. This process, inspired by systems thinking, helps you see how different viewpoints shape the system's behavior, identify potential conflicts or tensions, and uncover hidden dynamics. It's about making sure that you see the whole picture by looking from many different angles.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Perspective Exploration

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to explore perspectives.

### Principle 1: Who is Looking? (Identifying Stakeholders)
Imagine thinking about who is involved with the school â€“ students, teachers, parents, the principal. This principle means identifying the key people, groups, or even ideas that have a viewpoint on the topic or system.

**What is it?** Identifying the relevant individuals, groups, entities, or conceptual frameworks that have a perspective on the topic or system being analyzed. These are often called stakeholders.
**Why it matters:** Perspectives are held by someone or something. Identifying who holds the perspective is the first step to understanding it.
**How to do it:** Ask: Who is involved with this topic or system? Who is affected by it? What different groups or ideas are relevant?

### Principle 2: What Do They See? (Exploring Viewpoints)
Imagine thinking about what the student sees when they look at the school rules, and what the teacher sees. This principle means exploring the specific viewpoint of each identified stakeholder or entity.

**What is it?** Understanding and describing how the topic or system appears from the point of view of a specific stakeholder or conceptual framework. What are their concerns, priorities, and biases?
**Why it matters:** Each perspective offers a unique way of seeing the topic or system. Exploring viewpoints helps you understand these different ways of seeing.
**How to do it:** For each stakeholder, ask: What do they care about regarding this topic? What are their main concerns? How do they see the situation? What might influence their view (biases)?

### Principle 3: How Does Their View Change Things? (Influence on System)
Imagine how the principal's view on school rules affects how the rules are made and enforced. This principle means exploring how different perspectives influence the system.

**What is it?** Analyzing how the viewpoints of different stakeholders or conceptual frameworks shape the design, function, behavior, or outcomes of the system.
**Why it matters:** Perspectives are not just passive views; they actively influence how systems are created and how they operate.
**How to do it:** For each perspective, ask: How does this viewpoint affect how the system works? Does it lead to certain decisions or actions?

### Principle 4: Where Do Views Clash? (Identifying Tensions)
Imagine the student wants more recess, but the teacher thinks there isn't enough time for lessons. This principle means identifying tensions or conflicts that arise between different perspectives.

**What is it?** Identifying areas where the concerns, priorities, or goals of different stakeholders or perspectives are in conflict or tension with each other.
**Why it matters:** Tensions between perspectives can lead to disagreements, challenges, and affect the system's ability to function smoothly.
**How to do it:** Compare the viewpoints of different stakeholders. Where do their goals or concerns conflict?

### Principle 5: Do Views Change Over Time? (Perspective Evolution)
Imagine the student who wanted more recess grows up and becomes a teacher, and their view on recess changes. This principle means considering how perspectives might evolve over time or in response to changes in the system.

**What is it?** Reflecting on how the viewpoints of stakeholders or the way a conceptual framework is applied might change over time or as the system itself changes.
**Why it matters:** Perspectives are not always static. Understanding how they evolve provides a more dynamic view of the topic or system.
**How to do it:** Think about how the stakeholders' experiences or the system's development might cause their perspectives to shift in the future.

### Principle 6: Are There Any Missing Views? (Hidden Perspectives)
Imagine only thinking about the views of students and teachers, but forgetting about the view of the school bus driver. This principle means identifying hidden or underrepresented perspectives that haven't been considered but could be important.

**What is it?** Actively seeking out and identifying viewpoints of stakeholders or conceptual frameworks that are not immediately obvious or are often overlooked in discussions about the topic or system.
**Why it matters:** Hidden perspectives can reveal important aspects of the system that are not visible from the more obvious viewpoints.
**How to do it:** Think about who else might be involved with or affected by the topic or system, even indirectly. Are there any less powerful or less visible groups whose views are important?

### Principle 7: How Do Views Work Together? (Perspective Interaction)
Imagine how the student's view and the teacher's view both contribute to the overall experience of the school. This principle means exploring how different perspectives interact with each other and how these interactions shape the overall understanding of the system.

**What is it?** Reflecting on how the different perspectives identified relate to and influence each other and how considering multiple viewpoints together provides a more complete understanding of the system.
**Why it matters:** Perspectives don't exist in isolation. Understanding their interactions helps you see the complexity of a topic and how different views combine to shape the overall picture.
**How to do it:** After identifying multiple perspectives, think about how they relate to each other. Do they conflict? Do they complement each other? How does looking at all of them together change your understanding?
