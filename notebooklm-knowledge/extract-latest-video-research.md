## Introduction: What is Finding the Newest Video Link (Extracting Latest Video) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you follow your favorite cartoon show online, and you want to find the link to the very newest episode as soon as it comes out! Finding the newest video link is like looking at a special list that updates automatically (like an RSS feed) and finding the link to the most recent video on that list! It's about quickly getting the link to the newest video.

**What is it?** An RSS feed is like a special list that websites use to share updates, like new articles or videos. Extracting the latest video means looking at an RSS feed from a place like YouTube and finding the entry for the video that was added most recently. You then pull out just the website address (the URL) for that newest video. The output is only that URL.
**Why it matters?** If you want to watch the newest video from a channel or website right away, finding the direct link is the fastest way! By using this method, you can quickly get the URL for the latest video without having to visit the website and search for it. It's about getting direct access to the newest content! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super link finder and getting the newest video link!

## Core Goal: Finding the Website Address for the Very Newest Video!
The main point of finding the special video code (extracting latest video) is to analyze a YouTube RSS feed and extract the URL of the latest video, outputting only the URL in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To look at a special list of updates from YouTube (an RSS feed) and find the website address (URL) for the video that was added most recently, and then output only that code in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because video IDs are the unique identifiers for videos on platforms like YouTube. By extracting the video ID from a URL, you isolate the specific code that points directly to that video, which is valuable for various technical applications, sharing, or analysis. It's about making sure that the unique identifier for a video is easily extractable from its link.
