# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Key Ideas (Extracting Ideas) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Key Ideas (Extracting Ideas) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read something, and you want to find the most important thoughts or concepts that the author talks about! Finding key ideas is like reading text and pulling out the main ideas that the author wants you to understand! It's about spotting the central thoughts and concepts in what you read.

**What is it?** A key idea is a main thought or concept that is important in a piece of writing. Extracting ideas means reading text and identifying these important thoughts. You look for the main points that the author is trying to make. You then create a list of these ideas, writing each one as a short sentence (exactly 15 words).
**Why it matters?** Finding the key ideas in what you read helps you understand the most important information quickly! It helps you focus on the main points and remember what the writing is about. This is useful for learning, summarizing, or discussing the content with others. It's about getting to the heart of the message! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super idea finder and finding the key ideas in any writing!

## Core Goal: Finding All the Important Ideas in a Text!
The main point of finding key ideas (extracting ideas) is to analyze input text and extract all key ideas, presenting each as a 15-word bullet point in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find all the important ideas that the author talks about, and then write each of those ideas as a short sentence (exactly 15 words) and put them into a list using bullet points in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying and extracting the key ideas from a text is essential for understanding its core content and main arguments. By presenting each idea as a concise, 15-word bullet point, you create a summary that is easy to read and digest, allowing users to quickly grasp the most important concepts without reading the entire text. It's about making the process of identifying and reviewing the key ideas in a text efficient and effective.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Idea Extraction

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find ideas.

### Principle 1: What's the Main Point? (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading text and looking for the sentences that express the most important thoughts. This principle means identifying statements in the text that are key ideas.

**What is it?** Reading the input text and accurately identifying the statements or concepts that represent the most important ideas presented by the author.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the key ideas in the text to extract them.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. What are the main subjects discussed? What are the most important points the author is making?

### Principle 2: Are They Important Ideas? (Relevance)
Imagine finding a sentence that is just a small detail, not a main idea. This principle means selecting ideas that are relevant and represent the key points of the text.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the extracted ideas are relevant to the main topics and accurately represent the key points of the input text.
**Why it matters:** The output should focus on the most important ideas from the text.
**How to do it:** For each potential idea, ask: Is this a main point or just a detail? Does it represent a key concept in the text?

### Principle 3: Say It in 15 Words! (Conciseness)
Imagine the idea is explained in a long paragraph, but you need to write it in just 15 words! This principle means summarizing each extracted idea concisely, exactly 15 words per bullet point.

**What is it?** Summarizing each extracted key idea into a concise sentence that is exactly 15 words long.
**Why it matters:** Each bullet point needs to be a short, clear summary of an idea, meeting the specific word count.
**How to do it:** For each key idea, write a sentence that summarizes it and edit it to be exactly 15 words.

### Principle 4: Put It in a List! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the extracted ideas are just scattered around! This principle means presenting the extracted ideas as a bulleted list.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted key ideas as a list of items using bullet points in Markdown.
**Why it matters:** A bulleted list makes the ideas easy to read and scan.
**How to do it:** Use `-` or `*` at the beginning of each line for an idea.

### Principle 5: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of ideas includes your own ideas that weren't in the text! This principle means reporting the ideas as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted key ideas based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external ideas.
**Why it matters:** The extracted ideas should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on summarizing the ideas that are actually presented by the author in the text.

### Principle 6: Make It Right! (Accuracy)
Imagine the extracted idea from the text is wrong! This principle means ensuring the extracted ideas are correct.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the extracted key ideas accurately reflect the concepts presented in the input text.
**Why it matters:** The extracted ideas should contain correct information from the original text.
**How to do it:** Double-check that the ideas you extracted are accurate compared to the original input text.

### Principle 7: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of ideas is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
