# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Summarizing Computer Instructions (Summarize Prompt) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Summarizing Computer Instructions (Summarize Prompt) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you write a set of instructions for a smart robot, and you want a short description that explains what those instructions tell the robot to do! Summarizing computer instructions is like taking a set of instructions for a smart computer (a prompt) and writing a short paragraph that explains its main job, any special ways it should do the job, and what kind of answer it should give! It's about creating a brief explanation of what a computer instruction is for.

**What is it?** A prompt is a set of instructions or a question given to a smart computer program (like an AI) to tell it what to do. Summarizing a prompt means reading those instructions and writing a short paragraph that explains three main things: what the computer's main job is (primary function), if there are any special or unique ways it should do the job (unique approach), and what kind of answer or result it should produce (expected output). The summary focuses on *what the prompt is for*.
**Why it matters?** Prompts can sometimes be long or detailed! Summarizing prompts helps people quickly understand what a specific set of instructions tells a computer to do without having to read the whole prompt themselves. This is useful for organizing prompts, sharing them with others, or quickly remembering what a prompt is for. It's about making computer instructions easy to understand quickly! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super instruction explainer and summarizing computer instructions!

## Core Goal: Explaining What a Computer Instruction Is For in a Short Paragraph!
The main point of summarizing computer instructions (summarize prompt) is to analyze AI chat prompts by describing the primary function, unique approach, and expected output in a concise paragraph, focusing on the prompt's purpose.

**What's the goal?** To read a set of instructions for a smart computer and write a short paragraph that explains its main job, any special ways it should do the job, and what kind of answer it should give. The paragraph should focus on *what the instructions are for*.
**Why is this the goal?** Because concise summaries of AI prompts are valuable for quickly understanding their purpose and functionality without needing to read the full prompt text. By focusing on the primary function, unique approach, and expected output, you provide a clear overview of what the prompt is designed to achieve, which is useful for prompt management, sharing, and selection. It's about making sure that the purpose of computer instructions is easy to understand quickly.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Prompt Summarization

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to summarize prompts.

### Principle 1: What's the Main Job? (Prompt Analysis)
Imagine reading the instructions for the robot and figuring out its main job is to sort toys. This principle means understanding the content and intent of an AI prompt.

**What is it?** Reading and understanding the instructions given in the AI prompt to determine what task or goal the AI is being asked to perform.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the prompt to summarize it accurately.
**How to do it:** Read the prompt carefully. What is the main thing the AI is supposed to do?

### Principle 2: Find the Important Parts! (Information Extraction)
Imagine finding the part in the robot instructions that says it should sort toys by color. This principle means identifying the key elements of the prompt (function, approach, output).

**What is it?** Identifying the primary function (main job), any unique or specific approaches or methods the AI should use, and the expected output format or content from the prompt.
**Why it matters:** These are the key pieces of information to include in the summary.
**How to do it:** Look for descriptions of the task, any special instructions on how to do it, and what the final answer should look like.

### Principle 3: Make It Short! (Condensation)
Imagine explaining the whole robot instruction set in just one short paragraph. This principle means reducing the prompt details to a concise paragraph summary.

**What is it?** Taking the information about the prompt's function, approach, and output and condensing it into a single, short paragraph.
**Why it matters:** A concise paragraph is easy to read and understand quickly.
**How to do it:** Write a paragraph that includes the main job, unique approach, and expected output, using as few words as possible.

### Principle 4: What Is It For? (Focus)
Imagine the summary of the robot instructions only talks about the type of screws it uses! This principle means concentrating the summary on the prompt's purpose.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the summary paragraph focuses on *what the prompt is designed to achieve* or *what task it is for*, rather than getting lost in unnecessary details about the instructions themselves.
**Why it matters:** The summary should explain the prompt's purpose to someone who wants to use it.
**How to do it:** After writing the summary, check if it clearly explains what the prompt is used for.

### Principle 5: Just Show the Summary! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be only the summary paragraph, but you include extra notes! This principle means outputting only the resulting summary paragraph without additional text.

**What is it?** Presenting only the concise paragraph summarizing the prompt as the final output, without including any warnings, notes, or other commentary or formatting.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a clean, ready-to-use summary.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the summary paragraph and nothing else.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be a paragraph, but you output a list! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including outputting a concise paragraph and no unnecessary details or formatting.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including outputting a single, concise paragraph, focusing on the prompt's purpose, and not including unnecessary details or formatting.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Prompt Summaries Look Like (The Checklist!)
