# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Telling Stories About Security Progress (TTR-C Narrative) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Telling Stories About Security Progress (TTR-C Narrative) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you were really slow at fixing problems in your computer house, but you worked hard and now you fix them much faster! Telling stories about security progress is like sharing that story of how you got better at fixing important security problems! It's about taking numbers that show you're improving and writing a story that makes people feel good about the progress being made.

**What is it?** TTR-C is a measure of how quickly the most dangerous weak spots in computer systems are fixed. A narrative is a story. Telling a TTR-C narrative is about taking the numbers that show how TTR-C has changed over time (hopefully getting lower!) and writing a persuasive story that highlights the progress made in fixing those critical weak spots. You talk about where you started, the efforts made, and how much faster problems are being fixed now.
**Why it matters?** Numbers can show progress, but a story can make that progress feel real and inspiring! By creating a narrative about TTR-C improvement, you can effectively communicate the success of security efforts to people who might not understand the raw data. This helps build confidence in the security team and shows that important work is being done to make systems safer. It's about using storytelling to celebrate security achievements! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security storyteller and sharing stories about getting better at fixing problems!

## Core Goal: Telling a Compelling Story About Getting Better at Fixing Security Problems!
The main point of telling stories about security progress (TTR-C Narrative) is to analyze input data showing Time to Remediate Critical Vulnerabilities (TTR-C) over time and generate a persuasive narrative highlighting the progress made in reducing this metric.

**What's the goal?** To take data that shows how quickly critical security problems have been fixed over time (TTR-C) and write a persuasive story that emphasizes the improvement, showing how the time to fix these problems has gone down, to make people feel good about the progress.
**Why is this the goal?** Because communicating security progress effectively is important for gaining support and demonstrating the value of security efforts. A persuasive narrative can make data more relatable and impactful, helping stakeholders understand the significance of TTR-C reduction and the positive impact on security posture. It's about using the power of storytelling to highlight achievements in making systems safer.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Security Storytelling

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to tell security stories well.

### Principle 1: Understand the Numbers! (Data Interpretation)
Imagine looking at the numbers for how fast you fixed weak spots each month and seeing that the numbers are getting lower. That's good progress! This principle means understanding what the TTR-C data means and what trends it shows.

**What is it?** Understanding the meaning of the Time to Remediate Critical Vulnerabilities (TTR-C) metric and interpreting the trends shown in the data over time.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the data to tell an accurate story about the progress.
**How to do it:** Look at the TTR-C numbers for different dates. Are they going up or down? How much have they changed?

### Principle 2: Build a Story Around the Numbers! (Narrative Construction)
Imagine taking the numbers for cookie sales each day and writing a story about how your lemonade stand became more popular! This principle means building a compelling story around the TTR-C data points.

**What is it?** Structuring the narrative with a beginning (setting the context of the problem), a middle (describing the efforts made to improve), and an end (highlighting the progress achieved as shown by the data).
**Why it matters:** A story structure makes the narrative engaging and easy to follow.
**How to do it:** Start by describing the situation before the improvement efforts began. Then describe the actions taken. Finally, show how the TTR-C numbers improved as a result.

### Principle 3: Show How Much Better It Got! (Highlighting Progress)
Imagine the story about fixing weak spots really emphasizes how much faster you are now! This principle means focusing on the positive trends and improvements shown in the data.

**What is it?** Emphasizing the reduction in Time to Remediate Critical Vulnerabilities over time and highlighting the positive impact of this progress.
**Why it matters:** The goal is to create a persuasive narrative about improvement. Highlighting progress makes the story compelling.
**How to do it:** Use language that emphasizes the positive change. Mention specific numbers to show the improvement (e.g., "We reduced the time by half!").

### Principle 4: Make People Believe It! (Persuasion)
Imagine the story about fixing weak spots makes people feel confident that the computer house is safer now! This principle means writing in a way that convinces the audience of the progress made.

**What is it?** Using language and a narrative structure that is designed to convince the audience of the significance of the TTR-C reduction and the effectiveness of the security efforts.
**Why it matters:** The narrative should be persuasive to effectively communicate the value of the security program.
**How to do it:** Use compelling language. Connect the TTR-C improvement to the overall goal of making systems safer.

### Principle 5: Stick to the Facts! (Objectivity)
Imagine the story about fixing weak spots exaggerates how much faster you got! This principle means basing the narrative on the actual TTR-C data, not exaggeration.

**What is it?** Basing the narrative on the actual TTR-C data points and trends, without exaggerating or misrepresenting the progress.
**Why it matters:** The narrative should be trustworthy and accurately reflect the data.
**How to do it:** Use the real TTR-C numbers from the input data to support your story.

### Principle 6: Say It Clearly! (Clarity)
Imagine the story about fixing weak spots is confusing and you don't understand what TTR-C means! This principle means presenting the narrative in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.

**What is it?** Writing the narrative using clear and simple language that is easy for the audience to understand, even if they are not familiar with the TTR-C metric.
**Why it matters:** The narrative should be accessible to a wider audience.
**How to do it:** Explain what TTR-C means simply. Use clear sentences and avoid jargon where possible.
