# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Making Plans Better (Refine Design Documents) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Making Plans Better (Refine Design Documents) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you made a plan for building a super cool fort, and you show it to your friends, and they give you ideas for how to make the plan even better! Making plans better (refine design documents) is like taking a written plan for building something (like a computer program or a system) and using ideas from others to make the plan clearer, more complete, and easier to follow! It's about improving written plans based on feedback.

**What is it?** A design document is a written plan that describes how something will be built or how a system will work. A design review is when other people look at the plan and give ideas or point out things that could be better. Refining a design document means taking that written plan and making changes to it based on the ideas and feedback from the review. You make the plan clearer, fix any confusing parts, add missing information, and make sure it's easy for everyone to understand how to build the thing. You also make a list of all the changes you made to the plan.
**Why it matters?** Good plans are essential for building things correctly! If a plan is confusing or missing important details, the people building it might make mistakes or build the wrong thing. By making plans better based on feedback, you ensure that the plan is clear, complete, and easy to follow, which helps the building process go smoothly and leads to a better final result. It's about making sure the map for building is accurate and easy to read! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super plan improver and making plans better!

## Core Goal: Improving Written Plans Based on Feedback to Make Building Easier!
The main point of making plans better (refine design documents) is to revise an existing design document based on review feedback, implementing changes in Markdown to improve clarity, coherence, and completeness, and providing a summary of the modifications.

**What's the goal?** To take a written plan for building something and use the ideas and comments from others to make the plan better. You change the plan to make it clearer, fix confusing parts, add missing information, and make sure it all makes sense together. You do this using a specific computer format called Markdown, and you also make a list of all the changes you made to the plan.
**Why is this the goal?** Because design documents serve as blueprints for building systems, and incorporating feedback from reviews is crucial for identifying potential issues, clarifying requirements, and improving the overall quality of the design. By refining the document based on this feedback, you ensure that the plan is robust, well-understood, and provides a solid foundation for the building process. Providing a summary of changes enhances transparency and helps stakeholders track modifications. It's about making sure that the plan for building is accurate, complete, and easy for everyone to follow.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Plan Improvement

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to improve plans.

### Principle 1: Listen to the Ideas! (Feedback Incorporation)
Imagine your friends give you ideas for your fort plan, and you use those ideas to make the plan better. This principle means systematically addressing and implementing changes based on review comments.

**What is it?** Carefully reading and understanding the feedback provided during a design review and making changes to the design document based on that feedback.
**Why it matters:** Feedback from others can help identify problems or areas for improvement in the plan that you might have missed. Incorporating feedback makes the plan better.
**How to do it:** Read all the feedback comments. For each comment, figure out what change needs to be made to the plan.

### Principle 2: Understand the Plan! (Document Analysis)
Imagine trying to make changes to the fort plan without fully understanding the original plan! This principle means understanding the existing design document and its structure.

**What is it?** Carefully reading and understanding the original written plan (design document) to know how it is organized and what it describes.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the original plan to make changes correctly and ensure the revised plan is consistent.
**How to do it:** Read the design document thoroughly. What are the main sections? What does each section describe?

### Principle 3: Make the Changes! (Change Implementation)
Imagine actually drawing the new parts on your fort plan based on your friends' ideas. This principle means modifying the document content accurately and effectively.

**What is it?** Making the necessary changes to the design document's text and structure based on the review feedback, using the correct formatting (Markdown).
**Why it matters:** Implementing the changes updates the plan to address the feedback and improve its quality.
**How to do it:** Edit the Markdown file. Add new text, remove old text, or change existing text as needed to incorporate the feedback. Use Markdown formatting correctly.

### Principle 4: Make It Better! (Quality Improvement)
Imagine the fort plan is now much clearer and easier to follow because of the changes. This principle means enhancing the clarity, coherence, and completeness of the document.

**What is it?** Making changes that improve how easy the plan is to understand (clarity), how well the ideas flow together (coherence), and if all the necessary information is included (completeness).
**Why it matters:** A clear, coherent, and complete plan is essential for building something correctly.
**How to do it:** As you make changes, think about: Is this clearer now? Do the ideas connect smoothly? Is anything missing?

### Principle 5: Show What You Changed! (Transparency)
Imagine showing your friends the new plan and also giving them a list of all the ideas they gave you that you used. This principle means providing a summary of the changes made.

**What is it?** Creating a clear list or summary that describes the modifications that were made to the original design document.
**Why it matters:** A summary of changes helps people who reviewed the plan see how their feedback was incorporated and understand what is different in the new version.
**How to do it:** Keep track of the changes you make (e.g., "Added section on materials," "Clarified steps for assembly") and list them in a summary.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Formatting Adherence)
Imagine the plan is supposed to be drawn on a specific type of paper, and you use the wrong kind! This principle means ensuring the revised document uses valid Markdown.

**What is it?** Making sure that the rewritten design document uses the correct syntax and rules of the Markdown formatting language.
**Why it matters:** Using valid Markdown ensures that the document displays correctly.
**How to do it:** Use the correct Markdown for headings, lists, links, etc.

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including using Markdown and the specified sections.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and presenting the refined design document and the summary of changes in the specified sections with clear, concise, and organized content.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
