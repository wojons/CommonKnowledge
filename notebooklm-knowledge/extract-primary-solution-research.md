# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding the Biggest Solution (Extracting Primary Solution) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding the Biggest Solution (Extracting Primary Solution) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a story about a town with problems, and the story talks about different ways to fix them, like cleaning up litter, fixing roads, and building a playground. Finding the biggest solution is like reading that story and figuring out the single most important or main way that the story suggests to fix the town's problems! It's about spotting the main solution that is discussed.

**What is it?** The primary solution for the world (or a situation described in text) is the single most important or main way to fix a problem that is presented in a piece of writing or body of work. Extracting the primary solution means reading the text and identifying that one biggest solution that is discussed. You then present this solution.
**Why it matters?** Understanding the main solution that someone is proposing is important for understanding their perspective and evaluating their ideas. By finding the primary solution, you can quickly grasp the central way that the text suggests to address the main problem. This is useful for understanding arguments, analyzing viewpoints, or identifying the core approach being recommended. It's about getting to the heart of the fix! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super solution spotter and finding the biggest solution!

## Core Goal: Finding the Single Most Important Solution Presented in a Text!
The main point of finding the biggest solution (extracting primary solution) is to analyze input text and extract the primary solution for the world as presented in that text, outputting it in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and figure out the one most important idea and the one most important suggestion for what to do, and then write that biggest idea and best suggestion as a clear and short sentence (exactly 15 words) in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying both the central message and the primary actionable advice from a text provides a concise and valuable summary for the reader. By extracting these activities and presenting them in a clear list format, you provide a concise overview of the key actions or events, making it easy for users to quickly grasp what happened or what was done. It's about making sure that the most important actions in a text are clearly identified and summarized.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Solution Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find solutions.

### Principle 1: What's the Main Fix? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading text and thinking, "What is the one most important thing I should remember from this?" This principle means understanding the input text to identify its main point and key recommendation.

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to understand its overall content, main ideas, and any recommendations or suggestions provided.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text to find its main idea and key recommendation.
**How to do it:** Read the text multiple times. What is the main topic? What is the author saying is the biggest issue?

### Principle 2: What's the Best Advice? (Key Point Identification)
Imagine the text gives several tips, but one is the most important or helpful. This principle means identifying the single most important idea and the single most important suggestion for action or consideration.
**What is it?** Identifying the one central message that summarizes the text and the one most significant suggestion for action or consideration.
**Why it matters:** The output requires the single most important idea and key recommendation.
**How to do it:** After understanding the text, decide what the single biggest takeaway idea is and what the single most important piece of advice is.

### Principle 3: Say It in 15 Words! (Conciseness)
Imagine the main idea is explained in a long paragraph, but you need to write it in just 15 words! This principle means summarizing the main idea and the key recommendation concisely, exactly 15 words per sentence.

**What is it?** Summarizing the main idea into a sentence that is exactly 15 words long and summarizing the key recommendation into a separate sentence that is also exactly 15 words long.
**Why it matters:** Both the main idea and the key recommendation need to be short, clear summaries, meeting the specific word count.
**How to do it:** For the main idea, write a sentence that summarizes it and edit it to be exactly 15 words. Do the same for the key recommendation.

### Principle 4: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the main idea or key advice includes your own ideas that weren't in the text! This principle means reporting the main idea and key recommendation as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the main idea and key recommendation based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external ideas.
**Why it matters:** The output should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on summarizing the main idea and key recommendation that are actually in the input text.

### Principle 5: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the main idea and key advice are supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your main idea and key recommendation sentences using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
