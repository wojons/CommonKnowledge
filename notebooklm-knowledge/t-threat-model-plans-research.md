# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Problems in Plans (T Threat Model Plans) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Problems in Plans (T Threat Model Plans) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a plan for building a super tall LEGO tower, and you think about all the things that could go wrong â€“ maybe the wind could blow it over, or someone could accidentally knock it down! Finding problems in plans is like doing that for your life plans! It's about looking at your plans and thinking about all the bad things that could happen that might stop you from achieving your goals, and then thinking about how to prevent those bad things! It's about finding potential threats to your plans.

**What is it?** A life plan is like a roadmap for what you want to achieve in your life. A threat is something that could cause harm or stop you from reaching your goals. Finding problems in plans (threat modeling plans) means looking at your life plan (maybe in a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at other information you are given. You then think about all the possible bad things (threats) that could happen that might mess up your plan. For each threat, you think about how it could happen and what you can do to protect your plan (recommendations).
**Why it matters?** It's important to think about what could go wrong with your plans so you can be prepared! By finding problems in your plans, you can take steps to prevent those problems from happening or reduce their impact if they do happen. This helps make your plans stronger and more likely to succeed, even when unexpected things happen. It's about making your plans more resilient! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super plan protector and finding problems in plans!

## Core Goal: Identifying Potential Threats to a Life Plan and Recommending Ways to Protect It!
The main point of finding problems in plans (T Threat Model Plans) is to analyze input text and a life plan (TELOS File), create threat models for the plan, and recommend improvements to mitigate identified threats.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about someone's life plan (like in a TELOS File). You then think about all the possible bad things (threats) that could happen that might stop them from achieving their goals. For each threat, you think about how it could happen and what they can do to protect their plan. You then present the list of threats and the suggestions for how to make the plan better.
**Why is this the goal?** Because proactively identifying potential threats to a life plan allows individuals to anticipate challenges and develop strategies to mitigate risks. By applying a threat modeling approach to personal plans, you enhance their resilience and increase the likelihood of achieving goals despite potential obstacles. Providing recommendations for improvement offers actionable steps to strengthen the plan against identified threats. It's about making sure that potential problems in a life plan are found and that ways to protect the plan are suggested.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Plan Protection

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find problems in plans.

### Principle 1: What's the Plan and What's Happening? (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at the plan for the LEGO tower and also looking at the weather forecast. This principle means understanding the input text in the context of the life plan (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe a situation or new information) in combination with the information about the life plan (goals, steps, etc.) in the TELOS File to understand the full picture.
**Why it matters:** To identify relevant threats, you need to consider what is happening in the world or the person's life in relation to their plans.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. What is the input about? What is the life plan?

### Principle 2: What Bad Things Could Happen? (Threat Identification)
Imagine thinking about the wind blowing over the LEGO tower or someone knocking it down. This principle means recognizing potential threats or risks to the life plan.

**What is it?** Identifying potential events, situations, or actions (by others or by circumstances) that could negatively impact or prevent the achievement of the goals in the life plan.
**Why it matters:** Identifying threats is the first step to protecting the plan.
**How to do it:** For each goal or important part of the plan, think about what could go wrong. What are the potential obstacles or dangers?

### Principle 3: How Can We Stop Bad Things? (Mitigation)
Imagine thinking about adding more support to the LEGO tower to stop the wind from blowing it over. This principle means recommending actions to reduce the likelihood or impact of threats.

**What is it?** Suggesting specific steps or changes to the life plan or actions that can be taken to reduce the chances of a threat happening or lessen the negative impact if it does happen.
**Why it matters:** Mitigation recommendations provide actionable steps to make the plan more resilient.
**How to do it:** For each threat you identify, think about what could be done to prevent it or reduce its harm.

### Principle 4: Tell Them How to Make It Better! (Actionable Guidance)
Imagine suggesting, "Add extra support beams to the tower." This principle means providing concrete recommendations for improving the life plan's resilience.

**What is it?** Offering specific and practical suggestions for changes or improvements to the life plan or actions that can be taken to mitigate identified threats.
**Why it matters:** Recommendations provide a roadmap for strengthening the plan against threats.
**How to do it:** Based on the identified threats, suggest specific changes to the plan or actions to take (e.g., "Save emergency funds," "Learn a new skill," "Build a strong support network").

### Principle 5: Just Report What You See! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine saying the LEGO tower will definitely fall down even if the plan is strong! This principle means basing the threat modeling and recommendations on the available information, avoiding subjective judgments.

**What is it?** Identifying potential threats and recommending improvements based on the information presented in the input and TELOS File about the life plan, rather than injecting personal opinions or biases.
**Why it matters:** The threat modeling and recommendations should be objective and based on identifying realistic potential problems.
**How to do it:** Focus on what the input and TELOS File tell you about the life plan when identifying threats and suggesting improvements.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the threat models and recommendations, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only threat models and recommendations for improvement.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only threat models for a life plan and recommendations for improvement, and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
