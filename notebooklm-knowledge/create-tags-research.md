# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Tags for Ideas (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Tags for Ideas and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a box of toys, and you want to put labels on them so you can easily find the ones you want to play with, like a label for "cars" or "animals." Creating tags for ideas is like putting labels on your thoughts or information so you can easily find and organize them later! It's about using short words or phrases to describe what an idea is about.

**What is it?** A tag is a keyword or term assigned to a piece of information (like a document, article, or idea) to help categorize and find it later. Creating tags means reading a piece of text and identifying the most important words or concepts that describe what the text is about. You choose words that are like labels for the main ideas. You also include the name of the author or any existing labels if they are mentioned. You format these labels with a special symbol (#) so that computer tools can recognize them as tags.
**Why it matters?** Tags are super helpful for organizing and finding information! When you tag your ideas or documents, you can easily search for all the things related to a specific topic. This helps you keep your thoughts organized and makes it easy to find the information you need when you need it. It's about making your ideas easy to find and sort! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super label maker and creating great tags for your ideas!

## Core Goal: Labeling Ideas Clearly So They Are Easy to Find!
The main point of creating tags for ideas is to analyze input text and identify relevant keywords or concepts to be used as tags, formatted in a specific hashtag format for mind mapping tools, ensuring at least a minimum number of tags are identified.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find at least 5 important words or concepts that describe what the text is about, including the author's name or any existing tags if they are mentioned, and format these as hashtags (like #topic) so they can be used as labels for organizing ideas.
**Why is this the goal?** Because tags are a fundamental tool for organizing and retrieving information, especially in digital environments and tools like mind mapping software. By identifying relevant keywords and formatting them consistently as hashtags, you create a standardized system for categorizing and searching for ideas, making it easier to manage and access information. It's about providing clear and functional labels for your thoughts and resources.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Tag Creation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create tags well.

### Principle 1: What's It About? (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading about cars and needing to find the words "engine" or "wheels." This principle means identifying key keywords or concepts in the input text that describe the main ideas.

**What is it?** Reading the input text and accurately identifying the most important keywords, concepts, or topics that represent the core content of the text.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the words that best describe what the text is about to create relevant tags.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. What are the main subjects discussed? What are the most important terms?

### Principle 2: Make the Labels Fit! (Relevance)
Imagine putting a label for "animals" on a box of cars. That wouldn't fit! This principle means selecting tags that accurately represent the content of the text.

**What is it?** Choosing keywords or concepts as tags that are directly related to and accurately describe the content of the input text.
**Why it matters:** Tags should help people understand what the content is about and find it when they search.
**How to do it:** For each potential tag, ask: Does this word or phrase accurately describe a main idea in the text?

### Principle 3: Put It in the Right Code! (Format Adherence)
Imagine the label is supposed to have a special symbol (#) at the beginning, but you forget it! This principle means following the specific hashtag format for tags.

**What is it?** Formatting each identified tag with a leading hashtag symbol (#) as required for use in mind mapping tools or other systems that use this format.
**Why it matters:** The hashtag format is necessary for computer tools to recognize the tags.
**How to do it:** For every tag you create, put a `#` symbol right before the word or phrase.

### Principle 4: Add Enough Labels! (Completeness)
Imagine the box of toys is full of different things, but you only put one label on it. This principle means identifying at least the minimum number of required tags (at least 5).

**What is it?** Identifying at least 5 relevant tags from the input text to ensure a sufficient number of labels for categorization.
**Why it matters:** Having enough tags helps categorize the content more effectively and makes it easier to find through searching.
**How to do it:** After identifying potential tags, count them. If you have less than 5, reread the text to find more relevant keywords or concepts.

### Principle 5: Include the Author's Label! (Including Authors/Existing Tags)
Imagine the box of toys was given to you by your friend, and you want to add their name to the label. This principle means including the author's name or any existing tags if they are present in the input text.

**What is it?** Identifying and including the name of the author of the text or any existing tags mentioned in the input as part of the generated tags, formatted as hashtags.
**Why it matters:** Including the author or existing tags can provide additional context and help organize information related to specific sources or existing categories.
**How to do it:** If the input mentions the author's name or suggests existing tags, include them in your list of tags, formatted as hashtags.
