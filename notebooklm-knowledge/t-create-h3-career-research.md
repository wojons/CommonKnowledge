# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Giving Wise Thoughts About Plans (T Create H3 Career) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Giving Wise Thoughts About Plans (T Create H3 Career) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a plan for building a super tall LEGO tower, and you ask a wise friend to look at your plan and give you some smart ideas about it! Giving wise thoughts about plans is like looking at someone's plans and goals (like in a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at what they are doing now, and then giving them smart, insightful ideas based on how what they are doing fits with their plans! It's about giving wise advice based on plans and actions.

**What is it?** This is a way of thinking about plans and actions. It involves looking at information about someone's plans and goals (like in a TELOS File) and also looking at what they are doing now (input). You then think about how what they are doing fits with their plans and goals and share smart, insightful ideas (wisdom-based output) based on that. It's about connecting actions to plans and giving wise thoughts about it.
**Why it matters?** It's easy to get busy with what you are doing right now and forget about your bigger plans and goals! Getting wise thoughts about how your actions fit with your plans can help you stay on track, make sure you are working towards what's important, and get smart ideas about how to achieve your goals. It's about making sure your actions are aligned with your plans! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super wise planner and giving wise thoughts about plans!

## Core Goal: Providing Insightful Guidance by Connecting Actions to Plans and Goals!
The main point of giving wise thoughts about plans (T Create H3 Career) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File), synthesize the information, consider the relationship between them, and provide a wisdom-based output.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about someone's plans and goals (like in a TELOS File). You then think about how the information you were given fits with the plans and goals and share smart, insightful ideas (wisdom-based output) based on that connection.
**Why is this the goal?** Because understanding the relationship between current actions (input) and long-term plans and goals (TELOS File) is crucial for providing guidance that helps individuals stay aligned with their objectives. By synthesizing this information and offering wisdom-based insights, you provide valuable perspective and guidance that can inform decision-making and contribute to achieving goals. It's about making sure that actions are connected to plans and that smart thoughts are shared about that connection.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Wise Planning

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to give wise thoughts about plans.

### Principle 1: Look at What's Happening and the Plan! (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at someone building a small LEGO car and also looking at their plan to build a giant LEGO spaceship. This principle means understanding the input text in the context of the planning information (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe recent activities or a specific situation) in combination with information about plans, goals, and context (like in a TELOS File) to understand the full picture.
**Why it matters:** To provide wise thoughts, you need to consider what is happening now in relation to the bigger plans and goals.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. What is the input about? What are the plans and goals in the TELOS File?

### Principle 2: Put the Information Together! (Information Synthesis)
Imagine putting the information about the small LEGO car and the giant spaceship plan together to see how they relate. This principle means combining information from different sources (input and TELOS File).

**What is it?** Combining and making sense of the information from the input text and the TELOS File to form a comprehensive understanding of the situation and its connection to the plans.
**Why it matters:** Synthesizing information from different sources provides a holistic view for providing wise thoughts.
**How to do it:** Look for connections between the input text and the information in the TELOS File. How does what is happening now fit into the overall plans?

### Principle 3: How Does What's Happening Fit the Plan? (Relationship Understanding)
Imagine seeing that building the small LEGO car is a step in learning skills needed for the giant spaceship plan. This principle means identifying how the input text relates to the planning context in the TELOS File.

**What is it?** Figuring out the connection or relationship between the information in the input text and the plans and goals described in the TELOS File.
**Why it matters:** Understanding this relationship is key to providing wise thoughts about how current actions fit into the bigger picture.
**How to do it:** How does the activity described in the input contribute to or relate to the goals in the TELOS File? Is it a step towards a goal? Is it unrelated?

### Principle 4: Share Smart Thoughts! (Wisdom Application)
Imagine looking at the small LEGO car and the spaceship plan and thinking, "Building small cars is a great way to practice skills for the big spaceship!" This principle means providing insights and guidance that are insightful and valuable.

**What is it?** Providing output that offers valuable insights, smart observations, and helpful guidance based on the analysis of the input, TELOS File, and the relationship between them.
**Why it matters:** Wisdom-based output provides valuable perspective and guidance for the user.
**How to do it:** Based on your analysis, what are the most important insights or lessons learned about how the current actions fit into the plans? What guidance can you offer?

### Principle 5: Just Report What the Information Says! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine saying the small LEGO car is bad even if it's a good step in the plan! This principle means basing the output on the input and TELOS File, avoiding irrelevant information or personal biases.

**What is it?** Providing output that is based on the information presented in the input and TELOS File and the relationship between them, rather than injecting personal opinions or biases.
**Why it matters:** The output should be objective and based on the available information and plans.
**How to do it:** Focus on what the input and TELOS File tell you about the actions and plans when forming your wise thoughts.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just your smart thoughts, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only wisdom-based output.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only wisdom-based output and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
