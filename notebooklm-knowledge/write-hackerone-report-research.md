# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Writing Security Problem Reports (Write HackerOne Report) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Writing Security Problem Reports (Write HackerOne Report) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you find a broken lock on your school's bike rack, and you need to tell the principal exactly where it is, how you found it, and what someone could do because the lock is broken! Writing security problem reports is like doing that for problems you find in computer systems! It's about explaining a security weakness (a vulnerability) in a clear way so that the people who fix computer problems can understand it and fix it! It's about reporting computer security issues.

**What is it?** A security problem in a computer system is called a vulnerability. A security problem report is a document that explains a vulnerability you found so that the people who fix computer problems can understand it and fix it. This pattern involves taking information about a security problem you found and writing a report that is concise (short), clear (easy to understand), and reproducible (shows exactly how to find the problem again). You include details about what bad things could happen because of the problem (vulnerability impact), the exact steps someone can follow to see the problem themselves (steps to reproduce), and how someone could use the problem to do something bad (exploit details). These reports are often used on websites where people report security problems to companies (like HackerOne).
**Why it matters?** Finding security problems in computer systems is important for keeping them safe! But just finding a problem isn't enough â€“ you need to explain it clearly so it can be fixed. Writing good security problem reports helps the people who fix problems understand exactly what the issue is, how to find it, and how important it is to fix it. This helps make computer systems more secure for everyone! It's about making sure security problems are reported clearly so they can be fixed! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security reporter and writing security problem reports!

## Core Goal: Generating Clear and Reproducible Reports About Security Problems!
The main point of writing security problem reports (write HackerOne report) is to generate concise, clear, and reproducible bug bounty reports, detailing vulnerability impact, steps to reproduce, and exploit details for triagers.

**What's the goal?** To take information about a security problem you found in a computer system and write a report that is short, easy to understand, and shows exactly how someone else can find the problem too. You include details about what bad things could happen because of the problem, the steps to find it, and how someone could use it to do something bad. You write this report so that people who check security problems (triagers) can understand it and help fix it.
**Why is this the goal?** Because clear and reproducible vulnerability reports are essential for security teams to understand, validate, and fix security problems effectively. By providing a concise report that details the vulnerability's impact, provides clear steps to reproduce, and includes exploit details, you facilitate the process of addressing security weaknesses, which contributes to making computer systems more secure. This is valuable for bug bounty programs and overall cybersecurity efforts. It's about making sure that security problems are reported in a way that helps them get fixed quickly and correctly.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Security Reporting

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to write security reports.

### Principle 1: Say Exactly What the Problem Is! (Accuracy)
Imagine telling the principal the broken lock is on the door, but it's actually on the bike rack! That's not accurate. This principle means the report should accurately describe the vulnerability and its impact.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the description of the security problem, its location, and its potential consequences are correct and truthful.
**Why it matters:** Accurate reports are essential for the security team to understand and fix the correct problem.
**How to do it:** Double-check all the details about the vulnerability. Make sure you describe exactly what the problem is and where you found it.

### Principle 2: Make It Easy to Understand! (Clarity)
Imagine writing the report to the principal using complicated words they don't understand! This principle means the report should be clear and easy for a triager to understand.

**What is it?** Writing the report using simple, direct language that is easy for the security team (triagers) to read and understand, even if the technical details are complex.
**Why it matters:** Clear reports are easier to process and act upon, which helps get the problem fixed faster.
**How to do it:** Use simple sentences. Explain technical terms if necessary. Get straight to the point.

### Principle 3: Show Them How to Find It! (Reproducibility)
Imagine telling the principal about the broken lock but not telling them where the bike rack is or how you found the broken lock! This principle means the steps to reproduce the vulnerability should be clear and allow others to verify it.

**What is it?** Providing clear, step-by-step instructions that someone else can follow exactly to find the security problem themselves.
**Why it matters:** Reproducible reports allow the security team to confirm the vulnerability exists and understand how it works.
**How to do it:** Write down the exact steps you took to find the problem, starting from the beginning. Be very specific.

### Principle 4: What Bad Things Could Happen? (Impact Assessment)
Imagine telling the principal about the broken lock but not explaining that someone could steal the bikes because of it! This principle means the report should clearly explain the potential consequences of the vulnerability.

**What is it?** Clearly describing the potential negative effects or harm that could result from the vulnerability being exploited (like stealing data, taking control of a computer, or disrupting a service).
**Why it matters:** Understanding the impact helps the security team prioritize fixing the problem.
**How to do it:** Explain what a bad guy could do if they use this vulnerability. How much damage could it cause?

### Principle 5: Include Everything Needed! (Completeness)
Imagine the report about the broken lock is missing important details, like what kind of lock it is! This principle means the report should include all necessary details for a triager to understand and validate the vulnerability.

**What is it?** Including all the important information that the security team needs to understand, confirm, and fix the vulnerability, such as the type of vulnerability, the affected system, and any technical details.
**Why it matters:** A complete report provides all the necessary context for the security team.
**How to do it:** Make sure your report includes all the sections and information requested in the report format.

### Principle 6: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting the report about the broken lock into different sections, like "Where the Problem Is," "How I Found It," and "What Could Happen." This principle means presenting the information in a standard bug bounty report format.

**What is it?** Organizing the information in the report into specific sections with clear headings, following a standard format used for bug bounty reports.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the report easy for the security team to read and process.
**How to do it:** Use the standard sections for bug bounty reports (like Title, Impact, Steps to Reproduce, Exploit Details, Recommendations).

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be a report, but you output something else! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including generating a concise, clear, and reproducible report with specified details.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including generating a concise, clear, and reproducible bug bounty report that details vulnerability impact, steps to reproduce, and exploit details for triagers.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
