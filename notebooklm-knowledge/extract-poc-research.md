# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Security Test Links (Extracting PoC) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Security Test Links (Extracting PoC) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a report about a weak spot in a computer system, and the report includes a special link that shows how someone could actually use that weak spot to cause a problem! That special link is like a "Proof of Concept" or PoC. Finding security test links (extracting PoC) is like reading security reports and finding those special links and the instructions on how to use them! It's about finding the links that show how a security problem can be tested.

**What is it?** A security report is writing that describes security problems or weak spots in computer systems. A Proof of Concept (PoC) is like a demonstration or example that shows how a security problem can be exploited or tested. It's often a link to a website or a piece of code. Extracting PoC means reading security reports and finding the links (URLs) that are described as PoCs and any commands or instructions that show how to run or use that PoC to test the security problem. You then present the link and the command.
**Why it matters?** PoCs are important for cybersecurity experts to understand how security problems work and to test if systems are vulnerable. By finding and extracting PoC links and their validation methods, you make it easier for security teams to access and use these test tools. This helps them verify security problems and protect systems. It's about finding the tools that show how a security problem can be tested! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security tool finder and extracting PoC links!

## Core Goal: Finding Links and Commands to Test Security Problems!
The main point of finding security test links (extracting PoC) is to analyze security reports and extract Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs and validation methods (commands to run), outputting them in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read security reports and find the website addresses (URLs) that are Proofs of Concept (PoCs) for security problems, and also find the commands or instructions that show how to run or use those PoCs to test the problems, and then present the PoC link and the command in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because Proof of Concepts are valuable resources for cybersecurity professionals to understand and verify vulnerabilities. By extracting the key components of a recipe (description, ingredients, steps) from text, you provide a clear and usable guide for preparing the dish. This facilitates cooking and allows users to easily access and follow recipes found in various sources. It's about making sure that recipes are easily identifiable and presented in a format that is easy to follow in the kitchen.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for PoC Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find PoC links.

### Principle 1: What Shows How to Test a Problem? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading a security report and looking for links that are described as examples of how a weak spot works. This principle means understanding the security report to identify mentions of PoCs and validation methods.

**What is it?** Reading the input text (security reports) and analyzing its content to identify descriptions of Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and the methods or commands used to validate them.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the report to find the PoC information.
**How to do it:** Read the report carefully. Look for sections or phrases that discuss demonstrating or testing vulnerabilities.

### Principle 2: Find the Link and the Command! (Information Extraction)
Imagine the report gives a link to the test tool and also the command to run it. This principle means accurately pulling out PoC URLs and associated commands.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the specific website addresses (URLs) that are identified as PoCs and any commands or instructions provided to run or use those PoCs.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct link and command for the output.
**How to do it:** Look for URLs that are labeled as PoCs or exploit code. Find any commands that are shown for using the PoC. Copy them accurately.

### Principle 3: Are They Really for Testing Security? (Relevance)
Imagine the report includes a link to a funny video. That's not a security test link! This principle means focusing on information that is specifically a PoC URL and its validation method.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the extracted URLs are specifically identified as Proofs of Concept for security vulnerabilities and that the extracted commands are for validating those PoCs.
**Why it matters:** The output should focus only on relevant security test links.
**How to do it:** For each potential link or command, ask: Is this described as a way to test a security problem?

### Principle 4: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your output using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" PoC Lists Look Like (The Checklist!)
