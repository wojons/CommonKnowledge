# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Making Things Shorter (Summarize) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Making Things Shorter (Summarize) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a long story, and you want to tell your friend what it was about without telling them every single detail! Making things shorter (summarize) is like taking a long piece of writing or a video and telling the most important parts in a much shorter way! It's about getting to the main ideas quickly.

**What is it?** Summarizing means creating a shorter version of a text, video, or conversation that includes only the most important information. This pattern involves reading content and creating a very short sentence (exactly 20 words!) that summarizes the whole thing. You also find the main points that were discussed and the most important lessons or ideas you can take away from the content, and you list these using numbered lists.
**Why it matters?** We have so much information around us, and we don't always have time to read or watch everything! Summarizing helps you quickly understand the main ideas of something without having to go through all the details. This is useful for studying, getting the gist of an article, or sharing information with others efficiently. It's about saving time and getting the main points! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super shortener and making things shorter!

## Core Goal: Condensing Content to Its Essential Ideas and Takeaways!
The main point of making things shorter (summarize) is to summarize input content into a 20-word sentence, main points, and takeaways, presented in a specific Markdown format with numbered lists.

**What's the goal?** To read content and create a single sentence that is exactly 20 words long and summarizes the whole content. You also find the most important ideas and lessons from the content and list them using numbered lists.
**Why is this the goal?** Because concise summaries and clear identification of main points and takeaways are valuable for quickly understanding and retaining information from longer content. By adhering to specific constraints like the 20-word summary limit and using numbered lists, you provide a structured and easily digestible overview of the content's key elements. It's about making sure that the most important information is easy to find and understand quickly.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Summarization

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to summarize.

### Principle 1: Find the Main Idea! (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading the long story and figuring out the most important thing that happened. This principle means understanding the input content to identify key information.

**What is it?** Reading and understanding the input content to identify its main topic, central message, and most important ideas.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the content to summarize it accurately.
**How to do it:** Read the content carefully. What is it mostly about? What is the main point the author is trying to make?

### Principle 2: Make It Short! (Condensation)
Imagine taking the long story and telling it in just a few sentences. This principle means reducing the content to its essential elements.

**What is it?** Taking the original content and making it much shorter by keeping only the most important information and removing details.
**Why it matters:** The goal of summarizing is to make the content shorter while keeping the main ideas.
**How to do it:** Identify the key information and rewrite it using fewer words.

### Principle 3: What Should I Remember? (Information Extraction)
Imagine finishing the story and thinking, "The most important lesson was to be kind to others." This principle means identifying the most important points and takeaways.

**What is it?** Identifying the key main points that were discussed in the content and the most important lessons, insights, or ideas that a reader or listener should take away from it.
**Why it matters:** Main points and takeaways highlight the most significant information in the content.
**How to do it:** As you read, think about: What were the main topics covered? What are the most important things I learned?

### Principle 4: Use Just the Right Number of Words! (Conciseness)
Imagine the summary sentence needs to be exactly 20 words long. This principle means expressing the summary and points efficiently, often with specific word counts.

**What is it?** Writing the summary sentence and the descriptions of the main points and takeaways using a limited number of words, adhering to any specified word count constraints (like the 20-word summary).
**Why it matters:** Concise summaries and points are easier to read and remember.
**How to do it:** Write your summary and points, then edit them to make sure they are short and meet any word count requirements.

### Principle 5: Put It in Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine putting the summary in one section, the main points in another list, and the lessons in a third list. This principle means presenting the summary, points, and takeaways in a specific format.

**What is it?** Organizing the summary sentence, main points, and takeaways into predefined Markdown sections with clear headings and using numbered lists for the points and takeaways.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the summary and lists easy to read and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the provided headings and use numbered lists for the main points and takeaways.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules, like not using numbered lists! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including using Markdown, the specified sections, and numbered lists.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format, presenting the summary, main points, and takeaways in the specified sections, using numbered lists for the points and takeaways, and meeting the word count for the summary.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
