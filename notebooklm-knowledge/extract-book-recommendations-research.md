# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Suggestions in Books (Extracting Recommendations) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Suggestions in Books (Extracting Recommendations) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a book about how to be a better soccer player, and the author gives lots of tips on how to practice! Finding suggestions in books is like reading books and finding all the helpful tips and advice that the author gives! It's about pulling out the "recommendations" for things you can do.

**What is it?** A recommendation in a book is like a piece of advice or a suggestion for something you can do. Extracting recommendations means reading a book's content and finding the statements or phrases that are practical and actionable suggestions. You look for the tips and advice that the author is giving to the reader. You then create a list of these recommendations.
**Why it matters?** Books often contain valuable advice and suggestions for improving skills, solving problems, or achieving goals. By finding and extracting these recommendations, you can create a list of actionable steps that you can take based on what you read. This helps you apply the knowledge from the book to your own life or work. It's about finding the practical advice in books! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super advice finder and finding the recommendations in books!

## Core Goal: Finding Practical and Actionable Advice in Books!
The main point of finding suggestions in books (extracting recommendations) is to analyze input text (a book's content) and extract a large number (50 to 100) of particularly practical and actionable recommendations, outputting them as a bulleted list in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read the content of a book and find between 50 and 100 suggestions for things you can actually do (practical and actionable recommendations), and then put these recommendations into a list using bullet points in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because books often contain valuable advice that can help readers improve their lives or work. By extracting a significant number of practical and actionable recommendations, you create a curated list of concrete steps that the reader can take based on the book's content. This list serves as a valuable resource for applying the book's insights and achieving desired outcomes. It's about making the process of extracting and utilizing the practical advice from a book more efficient and effective.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Recommendation Extraction

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find recommendations.

Imagine the suggestion is to fly to the moon to practice soccer! That's not practical! This principle means selecting recommendations that are practical and actionable â€“ things you can actually do.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the extracted recommendations are practical and can actually be implemented or acted upon by the reader.
