# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Attack Stories (Threat Scenarios) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Attack Stories (Threat Scenarios) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a secret fort, and you want to think about all the ways someone might try to sneak in or mess with it. Creating attack stories (threat scenarios) is like making up stories about how a bad guy might try to attack a computer system! It's about thinking like a bad guy and writing down the steps they might take to find weak spots and cause problems, and also thinking about the good things the system can do.

**What is it?** A threat scenario is a story or description of how a potential security threat might occur against a system. Creating one involves: looking at a system (like a website or an app), thinking about all the ways a bad guy might try to attack it (attack methods), and writing a story about how that attack could happen, step by step. You also think about the dangers (risks) and the good things the system allows (opportunities).
**Why it matters?** Thinking about attack stories helps security teams understand the potential dangers to a system and find ways to protect against them *before* an attack actually happens. By writing down these stories, you make it easier to see how an attack might unfold and what weak spots need to be fixed. It's about using your imagination to find dangers and make systems safer! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security storyteller and creating attack stories!

## Core Goal: Thinking Like a Bad Guy to Find Weak Spots and Make Systems Safer!
The main point of creating attack stories (threat scenarios) is to analyze a system description and generate a narrative-based threat model, describing likely attack methods and balancing the potential risks and opportunities associated with the system.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of a computer system and write stories about how a bad guy might try to attack it, describing the steps they might take and the potential dangers, while also thinking about the good things the system allows, to help understand the risks and opportunities.
**Why is this the goal?** Because understanding potential attack methods is crucial for designing and implementing effective security measures. By creating narrative-based threat scenarios, you make the potential dangers more concrete and easier to understand for security teams and stakeholders. Balancing this with the system's opportunities provides a more complete picture for decision-making. It's about using storytelling to explore potential security risks and inform defense strategies.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Threat Storytelling

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create attack stories well.

### Principle 1: Understand the System! (System Understanding)
Imagine trying to think about attacking a fort without knowing where the doors, windows, or walls are! This principle means understanding the system you are analyzing.

**What is it?** Having a clear understanding of the system being analyzed, including its functionality, components, and how users interact with it.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand how the system works to identify potential ways it could be attacked.
**How to do it:** Read the system description carefully. Figure out what the system does and how its different parts work together.

### Principle 2: How Could a Bad Guy Attack? (Attack Vector Identification)
Imagine thinking about all the ways someone might try to get into the fort â€“ climbing the walls, sneaking through a secret tunnel, pretending to be a guard. This principle means recognizing potential ways an attacker could interact with or exploit the system.

**What is it?** Identifying potential entry points, weaknesses, or methods that an attacker could use to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt the system.
**Why it matters:** These are the starting points for your attack stories.
**How to do it:** Think about how users interact with the system. Are there any inputs? Does it connect to other systems? Are there any known weak spots in the technology used?

### Principle 3: Tell a Story About the Attack! (Narrative Construction)
Imagine just listing the steps a bad guy might take. This principle means presenting the threat information within a story-like framework.

**What is it?** Structuring the description of potential attack methods as a narrative or story that describes the steps an attacker might take to achieve a malicious goal.
**Why it matters:** Narrative-based threat models can be more engaging and easier to understand than just a list of vulnerabilities.
**How to do it:** For a potential attack method, write a story about how a bad guy might use that method to attack the system, describing the steps they would take.

### Principle 4: Think About the Good and Bad! (Risk/Opportunity Balancing)
Imagine thinking about the fort and only thinking about the dangers, not how it helps protect people inside. This principle means considering both the potential negative impacts (risks) and positive outcomes (opportunities) related to the system.

**What is it?** Considering both the potential security risks (dangers) posed by threats and the positive aspects or benefits (opportunities) that the system provides.
**Why it matters:** Understanding both risks and opportunities provides a more complete picture for decision-making about the system.
**How to do it:** After identifying potential attack stories (risks), also think about the good things the system allows people to do (opportunities).

### Principle 5: Say It Clearly! (Clarity)
Imagine the attack story is confusing and you don't understand how the bad guy got in! This principle means describing attack methods and their implications clearly.

**What is it?** Presenting the threat scenarios and the balance of risks and opportunities using clear and easy-to-understand language.
**Why it matters:** The threat model needs to be clear so that security teams and others can understand the potential dangers.
**How to do it:** Use simple language to describe the attack stories. Explain the potential impact of each attack clearly.

### Principle 6: Just Use the System Description! (Objectivity)
Imagine the attack story includes dangers that have nothing to do with the system you are analyzing! This principle means basing the threat model on the system description provided in the input, without adding unrelated threats or speculation.

**What is it?** Basing the threat scenarios and the discussion of risks and opportunities solely on the description of the system provided in the input, without injecting personal opinions or external knowledge about unrelated systems or threats.
**Why it matters:** The threat model should accurately reflect the potential dangers to the specific system being analyzed.
**How to do it:** Focus on creating attack stories that are relevant to the system described in the input.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Threat Scenarios Look Like (The Checklist!)
