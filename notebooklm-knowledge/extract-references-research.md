# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Where Ideas Came From (Extracting References) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Where Ideas Came From (Extracting References) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a story, and the author mentions another book or a famous painting. Finding where ideas came from (extracting references) is like reading text and finding all the mentions of other books, stories, art, or other sources that the author talks about! It's about pulling out the "references" to other works.

**What is it?** A reference in writing is when the author mentions another book, story, piece of art, or other source of information. Extracting references means reading a piece of writing and identifying all the mentions of these external sources. You look for names of books, authors, artists, titles of works, or phrases that point to another source. You then put these references into a clear list.
**Why it matters?** Authors often refer to other works to support their ideas, show where they got information, or suggest other things you might be interested in. By finding and extracting these references, you can learn about the sources that influenced the author or find other related content to explore. It's about tracing the connections between different ideas and works! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super source finder and extracting references!

## Core Goal: Finding All the Mentions of Other Works in a Text!
The main point of finding where ideas came from (extracting references) is to analyze input text and extract references to external sources (art, stories, books, literature, etc.), outputting them as a bulleted list in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find all the mentions of other books, stories, art, or other sources that the author talks about, and then put all those references into a list using bullet points in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because references provide context and connections to other works and sources of information. By extracting a list of references from a text, you provide a clear overview of the external sources that influenced or are related to the content. This is valuable for further research, exploring related topics, or understanding the intellectual background of the text. It's about making sure that mentions of other works are easily identifiable and accessible.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Reference Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find references.

### Principle 1: What Other Works Are Mentioned? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading text and looking for names of books or artists. This principle means understanding the input text to identify mentions of external sources.

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to understand its content and identify statements or phrases that mention external sources such as art, stories, books, literature, or other works.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text to find the references.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for names of authors, titles of books or works, or phrases that indicate a reference to another source.

### Principle 2: Is It a Reference? (Reference Identification)
Imagine the text mentions a type of tree. That's not a reference to a book! This principle means recognizing phrases or formatting that indicate a reference to an external source.

**What is it?** Distinguishing between mentions of external sources (references) and other information in the text.
**Why it matters:** The output should focus only on references to other works.
**How to do it:** For each potential reference, ask: Is this a mention of a book, story, piece of art, or other external source?

### Principle 3: Pull Out the Words! (Extraction)
Imagine copying the words that describe the references from the text. This principle means accurately pulling out the descriptions of the references.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the descriptions of the references to external sources from the input text.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct words for the references.
**How to do it:** Copy the text that describes the references accurately.

### Principle 4: Put It in a List! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the references are just scattered around! This principle means presenting the extracted references as a bulleted list.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted references as a list of items using Markdown bullet points or numbered lists.
**Why it matters:** A list format makes the references easy to read and scan.
**How to do it:** Use `-` or `*` at the beginning of each line for a reference.

### Principle 5: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of references includes a book you like that wasn't in the text! This principle means reporting the references as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted references based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external references.
**Why it matters:** The extracted references should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the references that are actually mentioned in the input text.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of references is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your list of references using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Reference Lists Look Like (The Checklist!)
