# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Making Security Reports Better (Improving Report Findings) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Making Security Reports Better (Improving Report Findings) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine someone finds a weak spot in a computer system, like a door that's not locked properly. They write a report about it to tell others how to fix it. Making security reports better is like taking that report about the weak spot and making it super clear, detailed, and professional so that the people who need to fix it understand exactly what the problem is, how risky it is, and how to fix it! It's about making reports about security problems easy to understand and act on.

**What is it?** A security finding is a description of a weak spot or vulnerability found in a computer system during a security test (like a penetration test). A report finding is the part of the report that describes this problem. Improving a report finding means rewriting and adding information to make it clearer, more detailed, and more helpful. This includes describing the problem, explaining how risky it is, suggesting how to fix it, providing links to helpful information, and summarizing the finding briefly. The goal is to make the report finding easy for people to understand and use to fix the security problem.
**Why it matters?** Security reports are used by people who need to fix security problems. If a report finding is unclear or missing important information, it's harder for them to understand the problem and fix it correctly. By making report findings better, you help security teams understand the risks and take the right steps to protect systems. It's about making sure that reports about security problems are clear and helpful! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super security report writer and making security reports better!

## Core Goal: Making Security Findings Clear, Detailed, and Actionable!
The main point of making security reports better (improving report findings) is to rewrite and enhance a security finding from a penetration test report, providing a detailed, structured, and professionally formatted output in Markdown, including specific sections, recommendations, references, and a summary, while adhering to strict constraints.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of a security problem found in a computer system and rewrite it to be very clear and detailed. You explain the problem, how risky it is, suggest ways to fix it, provide links to helpful articles, include interesting quotes, and write a short summary, all in Markdown following specific rules for how it should look and how many items or words to include.
**Why is this the goal?** Because clear, detailed, and actionable security findings are essential for effective vulnerability management and risk reduction. By enhancing report findings, you ensure that the people responsible for fixing security problems have all the necessary information to understand the issue, its potential impact, and the recommended steps for remediation. This facilitates faster and more effective security improvements. It's about making sure that reports about security problems are easy to understand and help people fix the issues quickly.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Report Improvement

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to make reports better.

### Principle 1: Explain the Problem Clearly! (Clarity and Detail)
Imagine the report just says, "There's a weak spot," without explaining where it is or what kind of weak spot it is! This principle means providing comprehensive and easy-to-understand information about the security finding and its risk.

**What is it?** Writing a detailed description of the security problem found, explaining what it is, how it works, and why it's a problem. It also includes explaining how risky the problem is.
**Why it matters:** People who need to fix the problem need to understand exactly what it is and why it's important to fix it. Clear and detailed descriptions help them do that.
**How to do it:** Write a clear title for the finding. In the description, explain the vulnerability in detail. In the risk section, explain the potential harm that could happen because of this problem.

### Principle 2: Tell Them How to Fix It! (Actionability)
Imagine the report says, "There's a weak spot," but doesn't say how to fix it! This principle means including practical recommendations for remediation (fixing the problem).

**What is it?** Providing clear and practical suggestions for steps that can be taken to fix the security vulnerability.
**Why it matters:** Recommendations tell people what they need to do to address the problem. Actionable recommendations are specific and easy to follow.
**How to do it:** Based on the type of security problem, suggest specific steps to fix it (e.g., "Update the software," "Change the password," "Add a security setting").

### Principle 3: Show Where to Learn More! (Credibility)
Imagine the report says, "This is a problem," but doesn't provide any links to articles that explain the problem or how to fix it. This principle means supporting the finding and recommendations with relevant and reliable references.

**What is it?** Providing links to helpful and trustworthy articles or resources that explain the security issue, the technology involved, and how to fix it.
**Why it matters:** References help people learn more about the problem and find detailed instructions for remediation. Using reliable sources makes the report more trustworthy.
**How to do it:** Find articles or websites that explain the vulnerability and how to fix it. Include links to these resources in the report.

### Principle 4: Say It Briefly! (Conciseness)
Imagine the summary of the finding is a whole page long! This principle means summarizing the finding effectively in a short sentence.

**What is it?** Writing a short sentence (less than 25 words) that captures the main idea and importance of the security finding.
**Why it matters:** A concise summary helps people quickly understand what the finding is about.
**How to do it:** Write a sentence that summarizes the problem and its importance, and make sure it's less than 25 words.

### Principle 5: Put It in the Right Boxes! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine the report finding is just a messy paragraph with everything mixed together! This principle means organizing the information into specific, well-defined sections.

**What is it?** Presenting the different parts of the report finding (Title, Description, Risk, Recommendations, References, Summary, Quotes) in separate sections with clear headings.
**Why it matters:** A structured format makes the report finding easy to read, understand, and find specific information.
**How to do it:** Use the provided headings (Title, Description, Risk, Recommendations, References, One-Sentence-Summary, Quotes) to organize your content.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the report is supposed to have a certain number of recommendations, but you include too many or too few! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including word counts, quantity requirements, bullet types, and negative constraints.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including word counts for the summary and quotes, the number of items for recommendations, references, and quotes, using bulleted lists, not repeating quotes or references, not starting bullets with the same words, using Markdown only, and not including markdown code syntax, bold, italics, warnings, or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely. Double-check word counts, list lengths, and negative constraints.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Improved Report Findings Look Like (The Checklist!)
