# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding ALL the Smart Ideas (Extracting Wisdom DM) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding ALL the Smart Ideas (Extracting Wisdom DM) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are looking for treasure in a big field, and you want to make sure you find *every single piece* of treasure, not just the easy ones! Finding ALL the smart ideas (Extracting Wisdom DM) is like reading text and making sure you find *every single valuable, surprising, insightful, and interesting piece of information*, leaving nothing out! It's about getting a perfect collection of all the wisdom in the content.

**What is it?** This is a way of analyzing text to find *all* the valuable information related to topics like life, people, technology, and learning. It's similar to finding wisdom, but with a super strong focus on not missing *any* valuable point. You look for summaries, ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, and recommendations, just like before, but the goal is to be completely comprehensive. The output presents all these findings in different sections, following strict rules for how it should look and how many words to use.
**Why it matters?** Sometimes, even small pieces of information can be very valuable or connect to other ideas in important ways. By making sure you extract *all* the valuable content, you get the most complete understanding possible from the text. This is important when you need to be absolutely sure you haven't missed any crucial insights or details. It's about achieving a perfect extraction of wisdom! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super thorough wisdom collector and finding ALL the smart ideas!

## Core Goal: Finding Every Single Valuable Piece of Information in Content!
The main point of finding ALL the smart ideas (extracting wisdom DM) is to analyze input text on specific topics and extract ALL valuable, surprising, insightful, and interesting information, providing a structured output with summaries, lists of ideas, insights, quotes, habits, facts, references, and recommendations, adhering to strict formatting and word count constraints, aiming for a perfect extraction.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text and find *every single* valuable, surprising, insightful, and interesting piece of information related to topics like life, people, technology, and learning. You then put all these different kinds of information into specific sections, making sure each item is short (like 15 or 16 words) and there are enough items in each list, all in Markdown without bold or italics or warnings, aiming for a perfect extraction compared to what an expert would find.
**Why is this the goal?** Because in-depth analysis sometimes requires capturing every single valuable detail to ensure a complete understanding and prevent missing crucial insights. By aiming for a perfect extraction of all valuable content, you maximize the potential for learning and application of knowledge from the text. This is particularly important when the content is highly valuable or when comprehensive analysis is required. It's about making sure that no valuable piece of wisdom is left behind.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Perfect Wisdom Extraction

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find all the wisdom.

### Principle 1: Don't Miss Anything Valuable! (Completeness)
Imagine the treasure hunter leaving some treasure behind because it was hard to find. This principle means making sure you find *every single* valuable, surprising, insightful, and interesting piece of information in the text.

**Why it matters:** The extracted wisdom must accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the information that is actually in the input text.

### Principle 8: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules, like using bold text or repeating bullet beginnings. This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including word counts, minimum quantities, bullet types, and negative constraints.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including word counts, minimum number of items for lists, using bulleted lists, not repeating information, not starting bullets with the same words, using Markdown only, and not including bold or italics or warnings/notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely. Double-check word counts, list lengths, and negative constraints.
