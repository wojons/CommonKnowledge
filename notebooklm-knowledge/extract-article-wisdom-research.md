# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Cool Ideas in Articles (Extracting Wisdom) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Cool Ideas in Articles (Extracting Wisdom) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read an article, and you find a sentence that makes you say, "Wow, I never thought of that!" or "That's really interesting!" Finding cool ideas in articles is like being a treasure hunter who reads articles to find the most surprising, insightful, and interesting pieces of information! It's about pulling out the "wisdom" from what you read.

**What is it?** Wisdom in an article is like the most valuable treasures â€“ the ideas, facts, or quotes that are surprising, make you think in a new way (insightful), or are just really interesting. Extracting wisdom means reading an article and finding these special pieces of information. You then organize them into different groups, like: a short overview (summary), the main ideas, interesting quotes, important facts, where the information came from (references), and suggestions for what to do (recommendations).
**Why it matters?** Articles can contain a lot of information, but not all of it is equally valuable or interesting. By finding and extracting the "wisdom" from an article, you can quickly get to the most important and thought-provoking parts. This helps you learn new things, get new ideas, and remember the most valuable information from what you read. It's about finding the hidden gems in articles! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super treasure hunter and finding the wisdom in articles!

## Core Goal: Finding the Most Interesting and Insightful Information in Articles!
The main point of finding cool ideas in articles (extracting wisdom) is to analyze input content and extract surprising, insightful, and interesting information, categorizing it into specific sections (summary, ideas, quotes, facts, references, recommendations) in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read an article or other content and find the information that is particularly surprising, makes you think in a new way, or is just very interesting, and then organize this information into specific sections like a summary, main ideas, quotes, facts, where the information came from, and suggestions for what to do, all formatted in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because not all information in an article is equally valuable. By focusing on extracting the most surprising, insightful, and interesting pieces, you prioritize the information that is most likely to be valuable and thought-provoking for the reader. Categorizing this information makes it easy to digest and utilize. It's about curating the most impactful information from a text.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Wisdom Extraction

**Why it matters:** The extracted wisdom should contain correct information from the original text.
**How to do it:** Double-check that the information you extracted is accurate compared to the original input text.
