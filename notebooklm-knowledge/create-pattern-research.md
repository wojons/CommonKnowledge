# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Documenting AI Prompts (Creating Patterns) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Documenting AI Prompts (Creating Patterns) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a special set of instructions that tells a smart computer (AI) exactly how to do a specific task, like writing a story or analyzing data. These instructions are like an AI prompt or a pattern! Documenting AI prompts is like writing a clear guide that explains what the AI is supposed to do, how it should do it, what the final result should look like, and maybe even showing an example. It's about writing instructions for the instructions!

**What is it?** An AI prompt or pattern is a set of instructions given to an AI to make it perform a specific task in a certain way. Documenting a pattern means creating a structured description that explains: What is the AI's job or role? What steps should the AI follow? What should the final output look like (the format)? Are there any examples of how it works? You organize all this information into clear sections.
**Why it matters?** When you have a good AI prompt or pattern, you want to be able to share it with others or remember how it works yourself. Documenting the pattern clearly helps people understand what the AI is supposed to do and how to use the pattern correctly. It's like writing a user manual for your AI instructions! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super instruction writer and documenting AI prompts so everyone can understand them!

## Core Goal: Explaining How an AI Pattern Works Clearly!
The main point of documenting AI prompts (creating patterns) is to analyze a description of an AI prompt or pattern and extract and organize the information into a structured documentation format that clearly explains the AI's role, instructions, output format, and examples.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of an AI prompt or pattern and create a document with specific sections that explain: the AI's identity and purpose, the steps the AI should follow, the instructions for the output format, and any examples provided, all presented clearly and accurately in Markdown.
**Why is this the goal?** Because AI prompts and patterns can be complex, and clear documentation is essential for others to understand and use them effectively. By extracting and organizing the key information into a structured format, you provide a comprehensive and easy-to-read guide to the pattern's functionality and requirements. It's about making sure that the instructions for the AI are themselves well-explained and accessible.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Pattern Documentation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to document patterns well.

### Principle 1: Find the Different Parts! (Information Extraction)
Imagine reading the instructions for the AI and needing to find the part that says what the AI's job is, or the part that says what the final result should look like. This principle means accurately identifying the different components of an AI prompt or pattern description.

**What is it?** Reading the input description of the AI prompt or pattern and accurately identifying the distinct pieces of information that describe the AI's role, the steps it should follow, the output format, and any examples.
**Why it matters:** You need to find all the relevant information to include in the documentation.
**How to do it:** Read the input carefully. Look for phrases that describe what the AI is, what it should do, what the output should look like, and any examples provided.

### Principle 2: Put the Parts in Boxes! (Categorization)
Imagine putting the part about the AI's job in one box, the steps in another, and the output format in a third. This principle means grouping the extracted information into predefined sections in the documentation.

**What is it?** Organizing the extracted information into specific, predefined sections in the documentation, such as "IDENTITY and PURPOSE," "STEPS," "OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS," and "EXAMPLE."
**Why it matters:** Organizing the information into sections makes the documentation clear and easy to read.
**How to do it:** Use the specified section headings. For each piece of information you extract, decide which section it belongs in.

### Principle 3: Say It Clearly and Correctly! (Clarity and Accuracy)
Imagine the documentation for the AI instructions is confusing or has mistakes! This principle means presenting the extracted information clearly and ensuring it accurately reflects the original description.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted information using clear and precise language and ensuring that it accurately represents the details from the original description of the AI prompt or pattern.
**Why it matters:** The documentation needs to be easy to understand and correct so that people can use the pattern effectively.
**How to do it:** Write the descriptions for each section clearly. Double-check that the information you extracted and wrote down is accurate compared to the original input.

### Principle 4: Put It in Order! (Structured Reporting)
Imagine the documentation has the examples listed before the AI's job description! That wouldn't make sense. This principle means organizing the documentation into a clear and easy-to-read format with specific sections in a logical order.

**What is it?** Presenting the documentation in a structured format with clear headings for each section, following a logical flow.
**Why it matters:** A well-structured document is easier for readers to navigate and understand.
**How to do it:** Use the specified section headings in the correct order.

### Principle 5: Just Document What's There! (Objectivity)
Imagine the documentation adds extra steps that weren't in the original AI instructions! This principle means documenting the pattern as described in the input, without adding your own ideas or interpretations.

**What is it?** Documenting the AI prompt or pattern based solely on the information provided in the input description, without adding personal opinions, interpretations, or external knowledge about how the AI *should* work.
**Why it matters:** The documentation should accurately reflect the pattern as it was designed.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting and presenting the information that is actually in the input description.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Pattern Documentation Looks Like (The Checklist!)
