# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Unhelpful Thoughts (T Find Negative Thinking) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Unhelpful Thoughts (T Find Negative Thinking) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are trying to build something, and you keep thinking, "I'm not good enough," or "This is too hard." Those are unhelpful thoughts! Finding unhelpful thoughts is like looking at what someone is thinking or writing (like in a journal) and trying to spot those thoughts that are negative or make them feel bad about themselves or the situation! It's about finding thoughts that are not helpful.

**What is it?** Unhelpful or negative thinking is when someone has thoughts that are pessimistic, self-doubting, or focus too much on problems or failures. Finding unhelpful thoughts means looking at information about how someone is thinking (maybe from a special file called TELOS File or other writing) and identifying these negative thoughts. You then point out these thoughts and give them encouragement that is direct and motivating ("tough love encouragement").
**Why it matters?** Unhelpful thoughts can make it hard to try new things, overcome challenges, or feel good about yourself! By finding these thoughts, you can become more aware of them and learn to change them into more helpful and positive thoughts. Getting encouragement, even if it's tough love, can help motivate you to address these thoughts and keep trying. It's about spotting the thoughts that hold you back! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super thought spotter and finding unhelpful thoughts!

## Core Goal: Identifying Negative Thinking and Providing Direct Encouragement!
The main point of finding unhelpful thoughts (T Find Negative Thinking) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File) to identify negative thinking and provide tough love encouragement.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about how someone thinks or plans (like in a TELOS File). You then try to find thoughts that are negative or unhelpful. You point out these thoughts and give encouragement that is direct and motivating ("tough love encouragement").
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying negative thinking patterns is important for promoting a more positive and constructive mindset. By analyzing relevant information and highlighting instances of negative thinking, you raise awareness of these patterns. Providing tough love encouragement offers direct support and motivation to challenge and change these unhelpful thoughts, contributing to personal growth and resilience. It's about making sure that unhelpful thoughts are identified and that direct encouragement is given to address them.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Thought Spotting

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to spot unhelpful thoughts.

### Principle 1: What Are They Thinking? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading your friend's journal and seeing thoughts like "I can't do it." This principle means understanding the input text and TELOS File content, including personal reflections.

**What is it?** Reading and understanding the input text (which might include thoughts or feelings) and information in a TELOS File to identify what someone is thinking, especially looking for signs of negative thinking.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the content to find the unhelpful thoughts.
**How to do it:** Read the input and TELOS File carefully. What is the person expressing about their thoughts or feelings?

### Principle 2: Look for Unhelpful Words! (Pattern Recognition)
Imagine seeing words like "never," "always," "impossible," or "failure" often in your friend's writing. This principle means identifying language or themes indicative of negative thinking.

**What is it?** Looking for specific words, phrases, or recurring themes in the input that suggest negative thinking patterns (like pessimism, self-criticism, or hopelessness).
**Why it matters:** Certain language patterns can be indicators of negative thinking.
**How to do it:** Look for words or phrases that express doubt, negativity, or focus on problems.

### Principle 3: Be Direct and Supportive! (Constructive Feedback)
Imagine telling your friend, "Stop saying 'I can't'! You are capable, so try again!" This principle means providing feedback on negative thinking in a way that is intended to be helpful, even if direct ("tough love").

**What is it?** Providing feedback that directly points out the negative thinking while also offering support and motivation for change.
**Why it matters:** Feedback about negative thinking needs to be clear but also encouraging to be effective.
**How to do it:** Clearly identify the negative thinking you observed. Then, provide encouragement that is direct and motivating, like a coach pushing an athlete.

### Principle 4: How Does It Fit the Plan? (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine seeing unhelpful thoughts in your friend's journal and thinking about how those thoughts might affect their plan to build the sandcastle. This principle means understanding negative thinking within the context of planning and goals (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the identified negative thinking in relation to the person's plans, goals, and overall context described in the TELOS File.
**Why it matters:** Understanding negative thinking within the context of plans helps you see how it might be hindering progress towards goals.
**How to do it:** How might these negative thoughts affect the person's ability to achieve their goals?

### Principle 5: Just Report What You See! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine saying your friend's thoughts are bad just because you don't agree with them! This principle means basing the identification of negative thinking on the input content, avoiding subjective judgments.

**What is it?** Identifying potential negative thinking based on the language and themes presented in the input and TELOS File, rather than injecting personal opinions or biases about the thoughts themselves.
**Why it matters:** The identification of negative thinking should be objective and based on the available information.
**How to do it:** Focus on what the input and TELOS File say about the person's thoughts and feelings when identifying negative thinking.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the identification of negative thinking and encouragement, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only the identification of negative thinking and tough love encouragement.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only the identification of negative thinking and tough love encouragement, and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
