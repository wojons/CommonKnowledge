# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding What You Need to Be Good At (Extracting Skills) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding What You Need to Be Good At (Extracting Skills) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you see a description for a job you want, and it says you need to be good at things like "using a computer" and "talking to people nicely." Finding what you need to be good at (extracting skills) is like reading that job description and finding all the things it says you need to be able to do! It's about spotting the "skills" that are required for a job.

**What is it?** A skill is something you are good at or can do (like knowing how to read, or being good at teamwork). A job description is writing that says what a job is and what kind of person they are looking for. Extracting skills means reading a job description and finding all the abilities or qualifications that are mentioned. You then figure out if each skill is a "hard skill" (like knowing a computer program) or a "soft skill" (like being a good listener). You put all these skills and their type into a clear table.
**Why it matters?** When you are thinking about buying or using a product, you want to know what it can do! By finding and extracting the product features, you can quickly understand the capabilities of the product and decide if it meets your needs. This is useful for comparing different products or learning about a new product. It's about understanding what a product offers! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super product detective and finding what a product can do!

## Core Goal: Finding and Categorizing What You Need to Be Good At for a Job!
The main point of finding what you need to be good at (extracting skills) is to analyze input text (a job description) and extract and classify skills, separating each skill and classifying it as either hard or soft, and presenting this information in a Markdown table.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text that is a job description and find all the things it says you need to be able to do (skills), and for each skill, decide if it's a "hard skill" (technical knowledge) or a "soft skill" (people skills), and then put all the skills and their type into a table in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because job descriptions outline the required qualifications and abilities for a role. By extracting and classifying these skills, you provide a clear overview of what is needed for the job, distinguishing between technical competencies and interpersonal abilities. This is valuable for job seekers, recruiters, and anyone trying to understand the requirements of a profession. It's about making sure that the skills needed for a job are clearly identified and categorized.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Skill Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find skills.

### Principle 1: What Do I Need to Be Able to Do? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading a job description and looking for sentences that say, "Must be able to..." or "Skills required:". This principle means understanding the input text to identify descriptions of skills.

**What is it?** Reading the input text (a job description) carefully to understand its content and identify statements or phrases that describe required or desired skills, abilities, or qualifications.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text to find the skills.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for lists of requirements or descriptions of what the job involves.

### Principle 2: Is It a Skill? (Skill Identification)
Imagine the job description says, "Must be 18 years old." That's a requirement, but it's not a skill! This principle means recognizing phrases or terms that describe a skill.

**What is it?** Distinguishing between descriptions of skills (abilities or qualifications) and other requirements (like age or location).
**Why it matters:** The output should focus only on skills.
**How to do it:** For each requirement, ask: Is this something someone needs to be able *do* or *know*?

### Principle 3: Is It a Hard Skill or a Soft Skill? (Classification)
Imagine the job description says "know how to use a computer" (hard skill) and "be good at teamwork" (soft skill). This principle means accurately categorizing skills as hard or soft.

**What is it?** For each identified skill, determining whether it is a hard skill (a technical ability or specific knowledge, like programming or speaking a language) or a soft skill (an interpersonal ability or personal trait, like communication or problem-solving).
**Why it matters:** Classifying skills helps organize them and understand the different types of abilities needed for a job.
**How to do it:** For each skill, ask: Is this a technical skill or a people skill? Is it something you learn through training or something related to your personality and how you interact with others?

### Principle 4: Pull Out the Words! (Extraction)
Imagine copying the words that describe the skills from the job description. This principle means accurately pulling out the descriptions of the skills.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the descriptions of the skills from the input text.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct words for the skills.
**How to do it:** Copy the text that describes the skills accurately.

### Principle 5: Put It in a Table! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the skills are just a messy list! This principle means presenting the extracted and classified skills in a table.

**What is it?** Organizing the extracted skills and their classification (hard or soft) into a table format with columns for "Skill" and "Classification."
**Why it matters:** A table format makes the skills and their types easy to read and compare.
**How to do it:** Create a table with two columns: "Skill" and "Classification." For each skill, add a row with the skill description in the "Skill" column and "Hard" or "Soft" in the "Classification" column.

### Principle 6: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of skills includes something you think is important for the job, but the description doesn't mention it! This principle means reporting the skills as presented in the input and classifying them based on standard definitions, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted skills based solely on the content provided in the input text and classifying them as hard or soft based on standard definitions, without injecting personal opinions or external skills.
**Why it matters:** The extracted skills should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the skills that are actually described in the input text. Classify them based on whether they are technical or interpersonal abilities.

### Principle 7: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the table of skills is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your table of skills using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
