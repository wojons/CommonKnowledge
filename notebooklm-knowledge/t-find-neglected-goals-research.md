# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Goals That Haven't Been Worked On (T Find Neglected Goals) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Goals That Haven't Been Worked On (T Find Neglected Goals) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a list of goals, like building a treehouse, learning to ride a bike, and finishing a puzzle. Finding goals that haven't been worked on is like looking at your list and seeing which goals you haven't done anything for recently! It's about finding the things you planned to do but haven't started or continued working on.

**What is it?** A goal is something you plan to achieve, and a project is a set of tasks to reach a goal. Finding goals that haven't been worked on means looking at information about a person's plans and goals (like in a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at what they have been doing recently. You then figure out which goals or projects from their plan haven't had any work done on them lately.
**Why it matters?** It's easy to make plans and set goals, but sometimes we forget about them or get busy with other things! Finding goals that haven't been worked on helps you remember what you planned to do and see if you are still working towards everything that is important to you. This is useful for staying on track with your plans and making sure you don't forget about important goals. It's about making sure your plans don't get left behind! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super goal reminder and finding goals that haven't been worked on!

## Core Goal: Identifying Goals or Projects from a Plan That Lack Recent Activity!
The main point of finding goals that haven't been worked on (T Find Neglected Goals) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File) to identify goals or projects that have not been worked on recently.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about someone's plans and goals (like in a TELOS File). You then figure out which goals or projects from their plan haven't had any work done on them recently.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying neglected goals or projects is important for ensuring that individuals stay focused on their priorities and make progress towards all their objectives. By analyzing recent activity in relation to the planned goals and projects, you highlight areas that may require renewed attention and effort. This is valuable for personal planning, project management, and ensuring that important goals are not forgotten. It's about making sure that goals that haven't been worked on are identified.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Goal Checking

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to check goals.

### Principle 1: What's Been Happening and What's the Plan? (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at what you've been doing this week and also looking at your list of goals. This principle means understanding the input text in the context of the planning information (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe recent activities or focus areas) in combination with information about plans, goals, and projects (like in a TELOS File) to understand the full picture.
**Why it matters:** To identify neglected goals, you need to see what has been happening recently in relation to what was planned.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. What has been done recently? What are the goals and projects in the TELOS File?

### Principle 2: What Are the Goals? (Information Extraction)
Imagine looking at your list of goals â€“ treehouse, bike, puzzle. This principle means identifying goals and projects from the TELOS File.

**What is it?** Identifying and extracting the list of goals and projects that are described in the TELOS File.
**Why it matters:** These are the items you will check for recent activity.
**How to do it:** Read the TELOS File and find the sections that list goals and projects.

### Principle 3: Has Anything Been Done Lately? (Activity Assessment)
Imagine looking at your goals list and seeing if you've done anything for the treehouse, bike, or puzzle lately. This principle means determining if recent activity (based on input or TELOS File) is related to specific goals or projects.

**What is it?** Comparing the recent activities described in the input text (or potentially in the TELOS File itself) to the list of goals and projects to see if there has been any work done on them recently.
**Why it matters:** This helps you determine which goals or projects have seen recent progress and which ones have not.
**How to do it:** For each goal or project, look at the recent activities. Is there any mention of work being done on this item?

### Principle 4: Which Ones Are Left Behind? (Identification of Gaps)
Imagine looking at your goals list and seeing that you haven't done anything for the puzzle lately. This principle means recognizing goals or projects that lack recent activity.

**What is it?** Identifying the goals or projects from the TELOS File that do not have corresponding recent activity based on your assessment.
**Why it matters:** These are the goals or projects that have been neglected.
**How to do it:** Which goals or projects did not have any recent activity related to them?

### Principle 5: Just Report What You See! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine saying you haven't worked on the puzzle even if you did! This principle means basing the identification of neglected items on the available information, avoiding subjective judgments.

**What is it?** Identifying neglected goals or projects based on the information presented in the input and TELOS File about recent activities and planned items, rather than injecting personal opinions or biases.
**Why it matters:** The identification of neglected items should be objective and based on the available information.
**How to do it:** Focus on what the input and TELOS File tell you about recent actions and planned goals when identifying neglected items.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the list of neglected goals, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only the implied identification of neglected goals/projects.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only the implied identification of neglected goals or projects, and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
