# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Git Commits from Changes (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Git Commits from Changes and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you're working on a drawing with friends, and you make some changes. You want to save those changes and write a little note about what you did so everyone knows! Git is like a special tool that helps teams work on projects together and keep track of all the changes. Creating Git commits from changes is like saving your changes to the project and writing that note about what you did, using a specific format so it's clear for everyone.

**What is it?** Git is a version control system that helps track changes in computer code projects. A "diff" shows you exactly what lines were added, removed, or changed in the code. A "commit" is like a snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time, along with a message explaining what you did. Creating a Git commit from changes means looking at the changes you made (the diff) and writing a short message about them (the commit message), and then using Git commands to save those changes. You use a special format for the message (conventional commits) to make it clear what kind of change it was (like adding a new feature or fixing a bug).
**Why it matters?** When teams work on code together, it's important to keep track of who changed what and why. Git commits help with this! By writing clear commit messages that follow a standard format, you make it easy for others to understand the history of the project, see what changes were made, and know why they were made. This helps teams collaborate effectively and manage their code projects. It's about saving your work with clear notes for your team! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super Git helper and creating great commits!

## Core Goal: Saving Changes with Clear Notes for the Team!
The main point of creating Git commits from changes is to analyze the modifications made in a project and generate the necessary Git commands to save those changes with a clear and standardized message explaining what was done.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of changes made in a project (like a Git diff) and generate the correct Git commands to stage (prepare) and commit those changes, including a commit message that follows conventional commit rules and summarizes the changes concisely.
**Why is this the goal?** Because in collaborative software development, tracking changes accurately and providing clear explanations for them is essential for effective teamwork and project management. By generating standardized commit messages and the corresponding Git commands, you facilitate a clear and organized history of the project's evolution, making it easier for developers to understand the codebase, revert changes if necessary, and collaborate efficiently. It's about making the process of saving and documenting changes in a project clear and consistent.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Git Commits

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create Git commits well.

### Principle 1: What Changed? (Change Analysis)
Imagine looking at the drawing and figuring out exactly what your friend added or erased. This principle means understanding the nature and scope of the modifications made in the project.

**What is it?** Examining the differences between the current version of the code and the previous version (like looking at a Git diff) to understand what was added, removed, or changed.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the changes to write an accurate commit message and decide how to categorize the change.
**How to do it:** Look at the lines of code that have been added or removed. What is the overall effect of these changes?

### Principle 2: Use the Right Label! (Conventional Commits)
Imagine using a special label on your saved drawing changes to show if you added a new color or fixed a mistake. This principle means using a standard format for commit messages that includes a prefix indicating the type of change (like "feat" for a new feature or "fix" for a bug fix).

**What is it?** Adhering to a standardized format for commit messages that includes a type prefix (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) followed by a concise description of the change.
**Why it matters:** Conventional commits make the commit history easy to read and understand. They help automate tasks like generating release notes.
**How to do it:** Based on the changes you analyzed, choose the appropriate prefix (e.g., `feat` for a new feature, `fix` for a bug fix, `chore` for maintenance). Write your commit message starting with this prefix.

### Principle 3: Say What You Did Briefly! (Summarization)
Imagine writing a short note about your drawing changes, like "Added blue color to the sky." This principle means condensing the explanation of the changes into a concise commit message.

**What is it?** Writing a brief and clear description of the changes made in the commit, suitable for the commit message title.
**Why it matters:** A concise commit message makes it easy for others to quickly understand what the commit is about.
**How to do it:** After analyzing the changes, write a short sentence that summarizes the main purpose of the commit.

### Principle 4: Tell the Computer What to Do! (Actionable Output)
Imagine writing down the steps for saving your drawing changes so someone else can do it. This principle means generating the actual Git commands that can be run to save the changes.

**What is it?** Generating executable shell commands (like `git add` and `git commit`) that perform the necessary actions to stage and commit the changes.
**Why it matters:** The user needs the correct commands to save their changes using Git.
**How to do it:** Use the Git commands `git add` (to stage changes) and `git commit -m` (to create a commit with a message).

### Principle 5: Be Accurate! (Objectivity)
Imagine writing a note about your drawing changes that doesn't accurately describe what you did. This principle means basing the commit message and the generated commands on the actual changes in the diff.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the commit message accurately reflects the changes made in the Git diff and that the generated Git commands are correct based on the desired action.
**Why it matters:** The commit history should be an accurate record of the project's changes.
**How to do it:** Review the changes in the diff and make sure your commit message accurately describes them. Ensure the Git commands are spelled correctly and use the right options.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Git Commits Look Like (The Checklist!)

Here's how you can check if your Git commits are super good!
