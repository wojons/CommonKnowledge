# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Drawing Pictures of Plans (T Visualize Mission Goals Projects) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Drawing Pictures of Plans (T Visualize Mission Goals Projects) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a big plan with different parts â€“ like your main mission (your biggest goal), smaller goals that help you reach your mission, and projects that help you achieve your goals. Drawing pictures of plans is like creating a visual map that shows how your missions, goals, and projects are all connected! It's about drawing a picture of your plans.

**What is it?** A mission is a big, overarching goal. Goals are smaller things you want to achieve that help with your mission. Projects are the specific tasks or activities you do to achieve your goals. Drawing pictures of plans means looking at information about someone's missions, goals, and projects (maybe in a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at other information you are given. You then figure out how they are all connected and draw a picture using simple text characters (ASCII art) that shows these connections.
**Why it matters?** Sometimes, seeing your plans in a picture makes them much easier to understand! A visual map helps you see how your smaller goals and projects contribute to your bigger mission. This can help you stay organized, prioritize your work, and make sure everything you are doing is helping you achieve your main goals. It's about making your plans easy to see and follow! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super plan artist and drawing pictures of plans!

## Core Goal: Creating Visual Maps of Missions, Goals, and Projects Using ASCII Art!
The main point of drawing pictures of plans (T Visualize Mission Goals Projects) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File) and generate an ASCII art diagram illustrating the relationship of missions, goals, and projects.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about someone's missions, goals, and projects (like in a TELOS File). You then figure out how they are all connected and draw a picture using simple text characters (ASCII art) that shows these connections in a diagram.
**Why is this the goal?** Because visualizing the relationships between missions, goals, and projects provides a clear and easily understandable overview of a person's planning structure. By generating an ASCII art diagram, you create a simple yet effective visual representation that helps individuals see how their smaller efforts contribute to their larger objectives. This is valuable for planning, organization, and maintaining focus on long-term goals. It's about making sure that plans are easy to see and understand visually.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Plan Visualization

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to draw pictures of plans.

### Principle 1: What's the Plan? (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at the information about your missions, goals, and projects. This principle means understanding the input text in the context of the planning information (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe a situation or new information) in combination with the information about missions, goals, and projects (like in a TELOS File) to understand the full planning structure.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the plans to draw a picture of how they are connected.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. What are the missions, goals, and projects described?

### Principle 2: Find the Pieces of the Plan! (Information Extraction)
Imagine finding the names of your missions, goals, and projects in your plan. This principle means identifying missions, goals, and projects from the TELOS File.

**What is it?** Identifying and extracting the list of missions, goals, and projects that are described in the TELOS File.
**Why it matters:** These are the elements you will include in your visual map.
**How to do it:** Read the TELOS File and find the sections that list missions, goals, and projects.

### Principle 3: How Do They Connect? (Relationship Mapping)
Imagine seeing that a project helps you achieve a goal, and that goal helps you achieve your mission. This principle means understanding how missions, goals, and projects connect and relate to each other.

**What is it?** Figuring out the connections and relationships between the identified missions, goals, and projects. How does one level of the plan relate to another?
**Why it matters:** The relationships are what you will show in your visual map.
**How to do it:** For each goal, which mission does it support? For each project, which goal does it help achieve?

### Principle 4: Draw the Picture with Text! (ASCII Art Diagram Generation)
Imagine drawing a diagram using only letters, numbers, and symbols on your keyboard. This principle means generating an ASCII art diagram.

**What is it?** Creating a visual diagram using simple text characters (like `-`, `|`, `+`, `>`, etc.) to illustrate the relationships between missions, goals, and projects.
**Why it matters:** ASCII art provides a simple way to create diagrams using only text.
**How to do it:** Use text characters to draw boxes, lines, and arrows that show how the missions, goals, and projects are connected.

### Principle 5: Make It Easy to See! (Visualization)
Imagine the picture of your plan is messy and hard to understand. This principle means representing complex information in a clear and visual format (ASCII art diagram).

**What is it?** Creating a visual map (an ASCII art diagram) that clearly shows the relationships between missions, goals, and projects.
**Why it matters:** Visual maps make complex information easier to understand than just reading text.
**How to do it:** Structure your ASCII art so that the connections and hierarchy of your plans are easy to see in the resulting picture.

### Principle 6: Just Use What You Were Given! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine drawing a picture of plans that weren't even in the input! This principle means basing the visualization on the available information, avoiding subjective interpretations.

**What is it?** Creating the ASCII art diagram based solely on the information provided in the input text and TELOS File about the missions, goals, and projects, without adding outside ideas or interpretations.
**Why it matters:** The visualization should accurately represent the information from the input.
**How to do it:** Focus on using the missions, goals, and projects mentioned in the input and TELOS File to create your diagram.

### Principle 7: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the ASCII art diagram, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only the ASCII art diagram.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only the ASCII art diagram, and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Plan Pictures Look Like (The Checklist!)
