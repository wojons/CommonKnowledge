## Core Goal: Finding the Best Ideas for New Businesses!
The main point of finding business ideas is to analyze input text containing business ideas, identify the top 10 most promising ones, and elaborate on their unique differentiators in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text that talks about different ideas for businesses or products, find the ideas that seem the most likely to be successful, choose the top 10 best ideas, and explain what makes each of those top 10 ideas special or different from other businesses.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying promising business opportunities is crucial for innovation and economic growth. By analyzing potential business ideas and highlighting what makes the best ones unique, you provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs and innovators. This process helps refine ideas, identify competitive advantages, and increase the likelihood of success for new ventures. It's about finding the ideas that have the greatest potential to create value and stand out in the market.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Business Idea Hunting

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find business ideas.

### Principle 1: Find the Ideas for Companies! (Idea Identification)
Imagine reading about different ways to make lemonade and finding an idea for a lemonade stand that also sells cookies. That's a business idea! This principle means recognizing statements or descriptions that represent concepts for businesses or products.

**What is it?** Reading the input text and accurately identifying statements, descriptions, or concepts that represent potential business ideas for products, services, or companies.
**Why it matters:** You need to find the business ideas in the text to analyze them.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for descriptions of new products, services, or ways of doing things that could be the basis for a business.

### Principle 2: Which Ones Seem Best? (Evaluation Criteria - Implied)
Imagine looking at different lemonade stand ideas and thinking about which ones would make the most money or have the happiest customers. This principle means using some way to decide which business ideas are the most promising.

**What is it?** Using implicit criteria (like potential market need, feasibility, or uniqueness) to evaluate the potential of the identified business ideas and determine which ones are the "top" or most promising.
**Why it matters:** You need a way to select the best ideas from the ones you find.
**How to do it:** As you identify business ideas, think about whether people would actually want this product or service, if it's possible to create it, and if it's different from what already exists.

### Principle 3: What Makes It Special? (Differentiation Analysis)
Imagine many lemonade stands sell regular lemonade, but one sells lemonade with unique flavors. That's what makes it special! This principle means identifying what makes a business idea unique or stand out from others.

**What is it?** Identifying the specific features, aspects, or approaches of a business idea that make it different from or better than existing products, services, or competitors.
**Why it matters:** What makes a business unique is often key to its success.
**How to do it:** For each business idea, think about how it is different from what is already available. Does it solve the problem in a new way? Does it serve a different group of people?

Imagine you found 20 ideas for lemonade stands, but you only want to focus on the 10 best ones. This principle means choosing a specific number of top business ideas (exactly 10).

**What is it?** Selecting the 10 business ideas that are evaluated as the most promising based on the implicit criteria.
**Why it matters:** The output requires a specific number of top ideas.
**How to do it:** After evaluating the ideas, choose the 10 that seem to have the greatest potential.

### Principle 5: Explain Why They Are Special! (Elaboration)
Imagine for each of the top 10 lemonade stand ideas, you explain what makes their flavors unique. This principle means providing additional detail about the unique aspects of the selected top ideas.

**What is it?** Providing a description or explanation of the unique differentiators for each of the top 10 selected business ideas.
**Why it matters:** Explaining the unique aspects helps people understand why these ideas are promising.
**How to do it:** For each of the top 10 ideas, write a short description of what makes it special or different.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of business ideas is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
