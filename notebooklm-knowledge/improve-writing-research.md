## Core Goal: Making Text Clear, Coherent, and Well-Written!
The main point of making writing better (improving writing) is to rewrite input text to improve its overall quality (grammar, style, clarity, coherence), preserving the original meaning and language, and outputting only the improved text.

**What's the goal?** To take text and rewrite it so it has no grammar mistakes, the sentences are clear and flow smoothly, and the overall style is good. You make sure it still says the same thing as the original text and is in the same language. You then show only the improved text, without any extra comments.
**Why is this the goal?** Because clear, coherent, and well-written text is essential for effective communication. By improving writing, you enhance its readability, ensure accuracy, and make it more engaging for the audience. This is valuable for anyone who writes, whether for school, work, or personal reasons. It's about making sure that your words are easy to understand and sound good.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Writing Improvement

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to make writing better.

### Principle 1: Say Exactly What You Mean! (Clarity)
Imagine writing an email, and the sentences are confusing, so the person reading it doesn't know what you want! This principle means making sure your writing is easy to understand.

**What is it?** Using clear and straightforward language to ensure that the meaning of the text is easily understood by the reader.
**Why it matters:** Clear writing is essential for effective communication. If your writing is unclear, people might misunderstand your message.
**How to do it:** Use simple words and sentence structures. Avoid ambiguity. Make sure each sentence has a clear meaning.

### Principle 2: Make Ideas Flow! (Coherence)
Imagine writing a story where the sentences jump from one idea to another without any connection. That's not coherent! This principle means ensuring the text flows logically and ideas are connected smoothly.

**What is it?** Organizing sentences and paragraphs in a logical order and using transition words or phrases to show how ideas relate to each other.
**Why it matters:** Coherent writing is easy for the reader to follow and helps them understand the connections between different parts of your writing.
**How to do it:** Use transition words (like "also," "but," "so") to connect sentences and paragraphs. Make sure each paragraph focuses on a single main idea.

### Principle 3: Fix Mistakes! (Grammar and Style)
Imagine writing a letter with lots of spelling mistakes or sentences that don't make sense. This principle means adhering to correct grammar rules and improving the overall writing style.

**What is it?** Correcting errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. It also includes improving the overall way the text is written to make it more engaging and pleasant to read.
**Why it matters:** Correct grammar and good style make your writing look professional and easy to read. Mistakes can distract the reader and make your writing harder to understand.
**How to do it:** Check for errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Rewrite sentences to improve their flow and impact.

### Principle 4: Keep the Same Idea! (Meaning Preservation)
Imagine rewriting a story about a dog, and the new story is about a cat! That doesn't preserve the meaning. This principle means maintaining the original message and intent of the text during rewriting.

**What is it?** Ensuring that when you rewrite text, the core meaning, facts, and intended message remain the same as in the original version.
**Why it matters:** The goal is to improve the *style* of the writing, not to change the *content* or *meaning*. Preserving meaning ensures the rewritten text is accurate.
**How to do it:** Read the original text carefully to fully understand its meaning and intent before you start rewriting. As you rewrite, check frequently to make sure the new text says the same thing as the old text.

### Principle 5: Stay in the Same Language! (Language Preservation)
Imagine writing in English and then rewriting it in Spanish! This principle means returning the improved text in the same language as the input.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the rewritten text is in the same language as the original input text.
**Why it matters:** The user provided text in a specific language and expects the improved version in that same language.
**How to do it:** Identify the language of the input text and make sure your rewritten output is in that same language.

### Principle 6: Only Show the Improved Text! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output includes extra comments like "I fixed this sentence." This principle means outputting only the improved text without any additional commentary or explanation.

**What is it?** Presenting only the final, rewritten version of the text as the output, without including any extra sentences, notes, or explanations about the changes made.
**Why it matters:** The output should be a clean, usable version of the improved text.
**How to do it:** Make sure your generated output contains only the rewritten text and no other commentary.
