# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding the Main Things People Do (Extracting Main Activities) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding the Main Things People Do (Extracting Main Activities) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a story about someone's day, and you want to find the most important things they did, like "woke up," "ate breakfast," and "went to school." Finding the main things people do (extracting main activities) is like reading that story and finding all the most important actions or activities that are described! It's about pulling out the main things that happen.

**What is it?** Activities are things that people do. Extracting main activities means reading a piece of writing and identifying the most important actions or activities that are described in the text. You look for the main things that happen or that people do. You then put these main activities into a clear list.
**Why it matters?** Understanding the main activities described in a text helps you quickly grasp what the text is about and what happened. This can be useful for summarizing, understanding a process, or learning about what someone did. It's about finding the key actions! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super activity spotter and extracting the main things people do!

## Core Goal: Finding the Most Important Actions Described in a Text!
The main point of finding the main things people do (extracting main activities) is to analyze input text and extract the main activities or actions described, outputting them as a list in Markdown.

**What's the goal?** To read a piece of text that is a conversation or interview and find all the sentences that are questions that were asked by the interviewer, and then put all those questions into a list in Markdown without bold or italics.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying the questions asked by an interviewer is crucial for understanding the flow and focus of an interview or conversation. By extracting a list of these questions, you provide a clear overview of the topics covered and the information sought, which is valuable for analyzing the interview, preparing for future interviews, or understanding the interviewer's technique. It's about making sure that the questions that drive a conversation are clearly identified and listed.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Activity Finding

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find activities.

### Principle 1: What Are People Doing? (Content Analysis)
Imagine reading text and looking for verbs that describe actions. This principle means understanding the input text to identify descriptions of activities or actions.

**What is it?** Reading the input text carefully to understand its content and identify statements or phrases that describe activities or actions performed by individuals or systems.
**Why it matters:** You need to understand the text to find the activities.
**How to do it:** Read the text carefully. Look for verbs and phrases that describe what the product does or has.

### Principle 2: What Are the Biggest Things Happening? (Relevance)
Imagine the story mentions someone blinking. That's an activity, but it's not a *main* activity! This principle means selecting activities that are the main or most important ones described.

**What is it?** Ensuring that the extracted activities are the main or most significant actions described in the text, rather than minor or irrelevant details.
**Why it matters:** The output should focus on main activities.
**How to do it:** For each activity you find, ask: Is this a main event or action in the text? Is it important for understanding what happened?

### Principle 3: Pull Out the Words! (Extraction)
Imagine copying the words that describe the main activities from the story. This principle means accurately pulling out the descriptions of the main activities.

**What is it?** Accurately extracting the descriptions of the main activities or actions from the input text.
**Why it matters:** You need the correct words for the activities.
**How to do it:** Copy the text that describes the activities accurately.

### Principle 4: Put It in a List! (Structured Formatting)
Imagine the main activities are just scattered around! This principle means presenting the extracted activities as a list.

**What is it?** Presenting the extracted main activities as a list of items using Markdown bullet points or numbered lists.
**Why it matters:** A list format makes the activities easy to read and scan.
**How to do it:** Use `-` or `*` at the beginning of each line for a main activity.

### Principle 5: Just Use What the Text Says! (Objectivity)
Imagine the list of main activities includes something you just thought of that wasn't in the story! This principle means reporting the activities as presented in the input, without adding interpretation.

**What is it?** Reporting the extracted main activities based solely on the content provided in the input text, without injecting personal opinions or external activities.
**Why it matters:** The extracted activities should accurately reflect the content of the original text.
**How to do it:** Focus on extracting the activities that are actually described in the input text.

### Principle 6: Follow the Rules for Showing It! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the list of main activities is supposed to be in a certain format, but you don't follow the rules. This principle means following the specific formatting rules for the output, like using Markdown without bold or italics.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified output instructions, including using Markdown format and not using special characters like bold or italics.
**Why it matters:** Following the formatting rules ensures the output is presented correctly and is easy to use.
**How to do it:** Format your list of main activities using Markdown. Do not use asterisks for bold or italics.
