# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Making Things Very Short (Summarize Micro) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Making Things Very Short (Summarize Micro) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you read a story, and you need to tell someone the main idea in just one super short sentence, and then give them only 3 main points and 3 lessons! Making things very short (summarize micro) is like taking content and boiling it down to the absolute most important parts using very few words and items! It's about making a super tiny summary.

**What is it?** Summarizing micro means creating a very, very short summary of content. This pattern involves reading content and creating a single sentence that is exactly 20 words long and summarizes the whole thing. You also find the 3 most important main points that were discussed and the 3 most important lessons or ideas to remember (takeaways), and you list these in a clear format. The goal is to get the absolute core of the content in a tiny package.
**Why it matters?** In today's busy world, people often need to understand the main ideas of something in just a few seconds! Making things very short helps you quickly share the most important information from content, like the main summary, the top 3 points, and the top 3 lessons. This is useful for quick updates, social media posts, or when you need to get the gist of something fast. It's about getting the essential information in a tiny nutshell! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super tiny summarizer and making things very short!

## Core Goal: Condensing Content to the Absolute Most Important Ideas and Takeaways in a Tiny Format!
The main point of making things very short (summarize micro) is to summarize input content into a concise, 20-word summary with main points and takeaways, formatted in Markdown.
