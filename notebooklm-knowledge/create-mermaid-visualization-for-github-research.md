# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Creating Visual Diagrams (Mermaid for GitHub) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Creating Visual Diagrams (Mermaid for GitHub) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you have a bunch of ideas in your head, and you want to draw a picture that shows how they are all connected, like a map of your thoughts! Mermaid is like a special code you can write that turns into a drawing of a diagram with boxes and arrows. Creating visual diagrams (Mermaid for GitHub) is about taking your ideas and writing this code so a computer can draw a picture that helps you and others see how everything fits together, especially in places like GitHub where you share code projects!

**What is it?** A visual diagram is a drawing that uses shapes (like boxes or circles) and lines (like arrows) to show ideas and how they are related. Mermaid is a way to write down the description of a diagram using simple text code that can be turned into a picture. Creating a diagram using Mermaid means taking complex ideas and their connections and writing the Mermaid code that will draw a picture showing these ideas as shapes and their relationships as arrows. The diagram should be so clear that someone can understand the ideas just by looking at the picture, and it's designed to work well in places like GitHub that support Mermaid code.
**Why it matters?** Sometimes, drawing a picture is the best way to understand complicated ideas and how they are connected! Diagrams help you see the relationships between different concepts, which can make them much easier to understand than just reading about them. Creating diagrams using code like Mermaid allows you to easily create and share visual representations of your ideas that can be displayed on websites or in documents, and it's especially useful in platforms like GitHub for explaining code structure or workflows visually. It's about using pictures to make complex ideas clear! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super idea artist and drawing diagrams that help everyone understand, especially in places where you share code!

## Core Goal: Drawing Pictures to Make Complex Ideas Clear!
The main point of creating visual diagrams (Mermaid for GitHub) is to translate complex ideas and their relationships into a clear and easy-to-understand visual representation using Mermaid syntax, showing the connections and structure between concepts in a standalone diagram that works well in environments like GitHub.

**What's the goal?** To take a description of complex ideas and how they are related and create a detailed diagram using Mermaid code that visually shows these concepts and their connections, ensuring the diagram is clear, can be understood on its own, and accurately represents the input, and also providing a short explanation of the diagram, with the output formatted for compatibility with platforms like GitHub.
**Why is this the goal?** Because visual diagrams are powerful tools for understanding and communicating complex information, particularly in technical contexts like software development. By representing ideas and their relationships visually in a clear and structured diagram using Mermaid, you can make abstract concepts more concrete and easier to grasp. Formatting the output for compatibility with platforms like GitHub facilitates easy sharing and display of these diagrams within code repositories and documentation. It's about using visualization to clarify and organize your thoughts in a way that is easily shareable in technical environments.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Diagram Creation

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to create diagrams well.

### Principle 1: What's the Idea About? (Conceptual Mapping)
Imagine you want to draw a picture about how different animals are related. You need to understand which animals are in the same family! This principle means taking your ideas and figuring out how to show them as shapes and lines in your drawing.

**What is it?** Translating abstract ideas and their connections into visual elements (shapes or nodes) and relationships (lines or edges) that can be represented in a diagram.
**Why it matters:** You need to figure out how to draw your ideas so the diagram makes sense.
**How to do it:** For each important idea, think about what shape could represent it (a box, a circle). Then think about how the ideas are connected. Should there be an arrow? What kind of arrow?

### Principle 2: Make It Easy to See! (Visual Clarity)
Imagine drawing a diagram where the lines are messy and the words are too small to read. That wouldn't be clear! This principle means creating a diagram that is easy for people to look at and understand.

**What is it?** Creating diagrams that are visually clear, well-organized, and easy for humans to interpret, ensuring that elements and text are readable and the layout is logical.
**Why it matters:** The diagram is meant to help people understand. If it's hard to see or confusing, it won't be helpful.
**How to do it:** Use clear shapes and lines. Arrange the elements in a logical layout. Make sure the text in the diagram is large enough and has good contrast against the background so it's easy to read.

### Principle 3: Use the Right Code! (Tool Proficiency)
Imagine trying to draw a diagram using a hammer! You need the right tool. This principle means using the specific syntax and format required by the Mermaid tool.

**What is it?** Using the specific syntax and format required by the Mermaid tool to create the diagram.
**Why it matters:** The diagram needs to be in a format that Mermaid can read and display correctly.
**How to do it:** Learn the Mermaid syntax for different types of diagrams (like flowcharts, sequence diagrams). Use the correct way to define nodes, edges, and labels in the Mermaid code.

### Principle 4: Show How Things Are Connected! (Relationship Representation)
Imagine the diagram where the boxes are just floating around without lines showing how they are related! This principle means accurately showing the connections between the ideas using arrows or lines and labeling them clearly.

**What is it?** Accurately depicting the connections, dependencies, or associations between the concepts in the diagram using appropriate visual connectors (lines or arrows) and labeling these connections clearly.
**Why it matters:** Relationships between ideas are often as important as the ideas themselves. Diagrams should clearly show these connections.
**How to do it:** For every relationship between two ideas, draw an arrow or line connecting their shapes in the diagram. Add a label to the arrow that describes the relationship.

### Principle 5: Make It Understandable on Its Own! (Standalone Diagram)
Imagine showing someone the diagram without any explanation, and they can still understand the main ideas and connections. This principle means creating a diagram that is clear enough to be understood even without extra text explaining the concepts themselves.

**What is it?** Designing the diagram so that it is clear and comprehensive enough to convey the core concepts and their relationships without requiring additional textual explanation of the concepts themselves.
**Why it matters:** A standalone diagram is a powerful communication tool that can be quickly understood.
**How to do it:** Ensure your diagram includes clear labels for all nodes and edges. Use a logical layout. The diagram should tell the story of the concepts visually.

### Principle 6: Explain How You Drew It! (Transparency)
Imagine showing someone the diagram and also explaining how you turned the ideas into the picture. This principle means providing a textual explanation of how the input was translated into the visualization.

**What is it?** Providing a textual explanation (in 10-word bullet points) that describes how the concepts and relationships from the input were represented visually in the diagram.
**Why it matters:** This explanation helps the user understand the mapping between the input and the visualization and ensures that the diagram accurately reflects the input.
**How to do it:** For each main part of the diagram, write a short sentence (10 words) explaining what input concept it represents and how it's shown visually.

### Principle 7: Follow the Rules for the Code! (Adherence to Format)
Imagine writing the special computer code for the diagram, but you forget some of the rules! The diagram wouldn't work. This principle means following the strict requirements for the output format (Mermaid syntax).

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to the specified format for the Mermaid syntax, including using the correct symbols for nodes and edges, and not including extra text or code block markers.
**Why it matters:** The output needs to be valid Mermaid syntax that can be imported and displayed correctly by the tool.
**How to do it:** Use the documentation for Mermaid syntax. Make sure your generated text follows the correct rules for defining your diagram elements. Do not include ```mermaid or ``` around the syntax.

## Best Practices: Your Toolkit for Creating Diagrams

These are like the special tools you can use to be an amazing idea artist.

### Understand the Ideas and Connections
**What it is:** Carefully analyzing the input to fully grasp the complex ideas and how they are related to each other.
**Why it's a best practice:** You need to understand the concepts to create an accurate diagram.
**How to do it:** Read the input multiple times. Identify the main ideas and look for how they are connected.

### Choose the Right Diagram Type
**What it is:** Deciding which type of Mermaid diagram (like a flowchart, sequence diagram, or class diagram) best represents the relationships in the input.
**Why it's a best practice:** Different diagram types are suitable for visualizing different kinds of relationships.
**How to do it:** Think about the nature of the connections between the ideas. Are they steps in a process? Interactions between components? A hierarchy?

### Use Clear Labels
**What it is:** Adding clear and descriptive text labels to the shapes (nodes) and the lines (edges) in your diagram.
**Why it's a best practice:** Labels help people understand what each part of the diagram represents.
**How to do it:** Label each shape with the name of the idea. Label each line with a clear description of the relationship.

### Generate Mermaid Syntax
**What it is:** Writing the diagram using the specific syntax of the Mermaid tool.
**Why it's a best practice:** This is the required format for the output diagram.
**How to do it:** Use Mermaid commands to define your nodes, edges, shapes, and labels.

### Write a Visual Explanation
**What it is:** Creating a section with 10-word bullet points that explain how the input concepts are shown in the diagram.
**Why it is a best practice:** This helps the user understand the mapping between the input and the visualization.
**How to do it:** For each main part of the diagram, write a short sentence (10 words) explaining what input concept it represents and how it's shown visually.

### Ensure Diagram and Explanation Match
**What it is:** Carefully reviewing both the generated Mermaid diagram (by visualizing it) and the textual explanation to make sure they perfectly correspond to each other and the input.
**Why it's a best practice:** The diagram and explanation should accurately represent the same information.
**How to do it:** Look at the diagram and read the explanation. Do they tell the same story about the input? If not, redo the diagram or explanation.

### Follow the Output Rules Exactly
