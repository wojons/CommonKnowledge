# Research Paper: Principles and Practices of Finding Hidden Thinking Problems (T Find Blindspots) (Enhanced for NotebookLM)

## Introduction: What is Finding Hidden Thinking Problems (T Find Blindspots) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are trying to build something, but you have a blind spot – a part you can't see – and you might make a mistake there! Finding hidden thinking problems is like looking at how someone thinks and trying to find the "blind spots" in their thinking, ideas, or plans that might cause problems or risks later! It's about finding potential issues in how someone thinks.

**What is it?** A blind spot in thinking is like a hidden area in your ideas or plans that you might not be seeing clearly, which could lead to mistakes or problems. Finding hidden thinking problems means looking at information about how someone thinks (maybe from a special file called TELOS File) and also looking at other information you are given. You then try to find these hidden blind spots in their thinking, ideas, or plans that could cause errors or risks. You point out these potential problems and also give encouragement.
**Why it matters?** Everyone has blind spots in their thinking sometimes! These hidden problems can lead to mistakes, missed opportunities, or unexpected risks. By finding these hidden thinking problems, you can become more aware of them and take steps to address them, which helps you make better decisions and avoid potential issues. It's about seeing the parts of your thinking you might be missing! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super thinking problem finder and finding hidden thinking problems!

## Core Goal: Identifying Potential Flaws in Thinking That Could Lead to Errors or Risks!
The main point of finding hidden thinking problems (T Find Blindspots) is to analyze input text and planning context (TELOS File) to identify potential blindspots in thinking, frames, or models that may expose the individual to error or risk, and provide this identification along with encouragement.

**What's the goal?** To look at information you are given and also information about how someone thinks or plans (like in a TELOS File). You then try to find hidden problems or "blind spots" in their thinking, ideas, or plans that could cause mistakes or risks. You point out these potential problems and also give encouragement.
**Why is this the goal?** Because identifying potential blindspots in thinking, frames, or models is crucial for mitigating risks and avoiding errors in decision-making and planning. By analyzing relevant information and highlighting these potential flaws, you empower individuals to become more aware of their cognitive biases or limitations and take steps to address them. Providing encouragement supports their efforts in self-improvement and critical thinking. It's about making sure that potential problems in how someone thinks are identified and addressed.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Blindspot Identification

These principles are like the directions on a compass, guiding you to find blindspots.

### Principle 1: How Are They Thinking? (Critical Analysis)
Imagine looking at how someone is trying to build something and seeing if they are missing any steps or using a weak method. This principle means examining thinking patterns and models for potential flaws or limitations.

**What is it?** Carefully analyzing the information about how someone thinks, their ideas, or their plans to identify potential weaknesses, biases, or areas where they might not be seeing the full picture.
**Why it matters:** Identifying flaws in thinking is essential for finding blind spots.
**How to do it:** Look for patterns in their reasoning, assumptions they might be making, or areas they might not be considering.

### Principle 2: Look at What's Happening and the Plan! (Contextual Analysis)
Imagine looking at what someone is building now and also looking at their overall plan to see if they are missing anything important. This principle means understanding the input text in the context of the planning information (TELOS File).

**What is it?** Analyzing the input text (which might describe current thinking or a situation) in combination with information about plans, goals, and context (like in a TELOS File) to understand the full picture.
**Why it matters:** Blind spots often appear when current thinking doesn't fully align with or consider the broader context of plans and goals.
**How to do it:** Read the input text and the TELOS File. How does the current thinking relate to the overall plans? Are there any gaps?

### Principle 3: What Could Go Wrong? (Risk Identification)
Imagine seeing a weak spot in the building plan that could cause it to fall down. This principle means recognizing potential errors or risks associated with identified blindspots.

**What is it?** Thinking about the potential negative consequences, mistakes, or problems that could arise because of the identified blind spots in thinking, ideas, or plans.
**Why it matters:** Blind spots can lead to real problems. Identifying the potential risks helps emphasize the importance of addressing the blind spot.
**How to do it:** For each blind spot you identify, think about what kind of error or problem it could lead to.

### Principle 4: Be Helpful and Kind! (Constructive Feedback)
Imagine telling your friend about the blind spot in their building plan in a way that helps them fix it and makes them feel encouraged. This principle means providing identification of blindspots in a way that is helpful and encouraging.

**What is it?** Presenting the identified blind spots and potential risks in a way that is supportive, helpful, and encourages the user to address them, rather than being critical or discouraging.
**Why it matters:** Feedback about blind spots can be difficult to hear. Providing it constructively helps the user receive it positively and motivates them to improve.
**How to do it:** Use encouraging language. Frame the blind spots as opportunities for growth. Offer support in addressing them.

### Principle 5: Just Report What You See! (Objectivity - Implied)
Imagine saying the building plan is bad just because you don't like the design! This principle means basing the identification of blindspots on the available information, avoiding subjective judgments.

**What is it?** Identifying potential blind spots based on the information presented in the input and TELOS File, rather than injecting personal opinions or biases about the thinking or plans.
**Why it matters:** The identification of blind spots should be objective and based on the available information.
**How to do it:** Focus on what the input and TELOS File tell you about the thinking and plans when identifying blind spots.

### Principle 6: Follow All the Rules! (Adherence to Constraints)
Imagine the output is supposed to be just the description of blind spots and encouragement, but you include extra notes! This principle means following all the specific formatting rules for the output, including providing only the implied description of blindspots and risks, and encouragement.

**What is it?** Adhering strictly to all the specified output instructions, including providing only the implied description of identified blind spots and potential risks, along with encouragement, and no warnings or notes.
**Why it matters:** Following all the constraints ensures the output is presented correctly and meets all the requirements of the pattern.
**How to do it:** Pay close attention to all the output instructions and make sure your generated content matches them precisely.
