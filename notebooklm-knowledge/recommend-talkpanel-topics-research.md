## Introduction: What is Suggesting Talk Ideas (Recommend Talk/Panel Topics) and Why Does It Matter?
Imagine you are really good at building LEGOs, and someone asks you for ideas for a presentation at a LEGO building club meeting! Suggesting talk ideas is like thinking about what someone is good at or interested in and coming up with ideas for talks or discussions they could give, especially for an event where people share knowledge! It's about finding good topics for someone to talk about.

**What is it?** A talk or panel topic is an idea for a presentation or a discussion at an event like a conference or a meeting. Suggesting talk ideas means looking at what a person is interested in or good at and coming up with ideas for topics they could talk about. This pattern involves analyzing what someone tells you about their interests and goals, thinking about relevant topics in those areas, creating ideas for talks or discussions, and presenting them in a clear list that could be sent to the people organizing the event.
**Why it matters?** People often have valuable knowledge and experiences to share, but they might need help figuring out what to talk about! Suggesting talk ideas helps people find good topics for presentations that match their expertise and would be interesting to an audience. This is useful for speakers, conference organizers, and anyone who wants to share knowledge effectively. It's about helping people find their voice and share their ideas! This paper is like your guide to becoming a super topic finder and suggesting talk ideas!

## Core Goal: Generating Relevant and Engaging Talk Ideas Based on a Person's Interests!
The main point of suggesting talk ideas (recommend talk/panel topics) is to analyze a person's interests and goals and generate a set of relevant talk or panel topic ideas, formatted for submission to a conference organizer.

**What's the goal?** To understand what a person is interested in and what they want to achieve, and then come up with a list of good ideas for talks or discussions they could give. You make sure these ideas are relevant to their interests and are presented in a clear way that could be sent to the people organizing an event where they might speak.
**Why is this the goal?** Because helping individuals identify relevant and engaging topics for presentations empowers them to share their knowledge and expertise effectively with an audience. By analyzing their interests and goals and formulating potential talk ideas, you facilitate their participation in knowledge-sharing events and contribute to the development of valuable content for conferences and discussions. It's about making sure that people who have interesting things to say can find good topics to talk about.

## Guiding Principles: Your Compass for Topic Generation
