# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Generating instruction sets for the "Common Knowledge" Context Pack based on the provided meta-prompt.
- Incorporating research findings on NotebookLM limitations and best practices into the content generation process.
- Managing the overall process using the `sequentialthinking` tool.
- Creating a web interface for selecting and merging knowledge files from the project.

## Recent Changes

- Merged the unique content from the `knowledge/` directory into the `patterns/` directory and deleted the `knowledge/` directory.
- Updated `README.md` to include information about the source of the patterns and the project's license.
- Created the `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
- Performed web search research on NotebookLM limitations and best practices for sources.
- Updated Memory Bank based on existing knowledge entries in `notebooklm-knowledge/`.
- Created a web interface (index.html, style.css, script.js) for selecting and merging knowledge files.
- Implemented file selection functionality for both patterns and NotebookLM knowledge directories.
- Added Fabric project reference and MIT license notice to the web interface.
- Committed and pushed the web interface files to the GitHub repository.

## Next Steps

- Generate the remaining instruction sets based on the meta-prompt and the refined approach.
- Incorporate the NotebookLM research findings into the content and presentation of the instruction sets.
- Continue processing remaining chatlog content to further populate the memory bank (if applicable).
- Identify and document any `.clinerules` based on the project requirements and user interactions (if applicable).
- Enhance the web interface with additional features:
  - Implement the file merging functionality
  - Add a preview feature for selected files
  - Improve the UI/UX with better styling and responsive design
  - Add export options for merged content

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- [ ] Document any active decisions and considerations.
- Processed the 'suggest_pattern' pattern and created the NotebookLM knowledge entry.
- Processed the 'summarize' pattern and created the NotebookLM knowledge entry.
- Decided to use a simple, clean interface for the web tool to make it accessible and easy to use.
- Used checkboxes for file selection to allow multiple files to be selected simultaneously.
- Organized the interface by directory type (Patterns and NotebookLM Knowledge) for better usability.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- [ ] Note any important patterns and preferences.
- The web interface follows a similar design approach to the user's previous project (ContextPack).
- Files are organized in a hierarchical structure for better navigation.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- NotebookLM functions as a teaching system, requiring source content to be informative and educational, not just directive instructions.
- Effective sources for NotebookLM should provide the "what" and "why" behind best practices, not just the "how".
- Understanding NotebookLM's source limitations (size, number of files) is important for structuring the Context Pack.
- AI deep research systems often work by iteratively processing information from multiple sources, synthesizing results, and breaking down complex questions.
- To enable NotebookLM to perform deep research-like tasks, the Context Pack should provide comprehensive, principle-based knowledge that can be applied across various inquiries within a domain.
- A web-based interface provides an accessible way for users to interact with the knowledge files without needing to understand the underlying file structure or command-line operations.
