# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Generating instruction sets for the "Common Knowledge" Context Pack based on the provided meta-prompt.
- Incorporating research findings on NotebookLM limitations and best practices into the content generation process.
- Managing the overall process using the `sequentialthinking` tool.

## Recent Changes

- Merged the unique content from the `knowledge/` directory into the `patterns/` directory and deleted the `knowledge/` directory.
- Updated `README.md` to include information about the source of the patterns and the project's license.
- Created the `LICENSE` file with the MIT license.
- Performed web search research on NotebookLM limitations and best practices for sources.
- Updated Memory Bank based on existing knowledge entries in `notebooklm-knowledge/`.

## Next Steps

- Generate the remaining instruction sets based on the meta-prompt and the refined approach.
- Incorporate the NotebookLM research findings into the content and presentation of the instruction sets.
- Continue processing remaining chatlog content to further populate the memory bank (if applicable).
- Identify and document any `.clinerules` based on the project requirements and user interactions (if applicable).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- [ ] Document any active decisions and considerations.
- Processed the 'suggest_pattern' pattern and created the NotebookLM knowledge entry.
- Processed the 'summarize' pattern and created the NotebookLM knowledge entry.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- [ ] Note any important patterns and preferences.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- NotebookLM functions as a teaching system, requiring source content to be informative and educational, not just directive instructions.
- Effective sources for NotebookLM should provide the "what" and "why" behind best practices, not just the "how".
- Understanding NotebookLM's source limitations (size, number of files) is important for structuring the Context Pack.
- AI deep research systems often work by iteratively processing information from multiple sources, synthesizing results, and breaking down complex questions.
- To enable NotebookLM to perform deep research-like tasks, the Context Pack should provide comprehensive, principle-based knowledge that can be applied across various inquiries within a domain.
