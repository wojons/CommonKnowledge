## What's Left to Build

- Complete the web interface functionality for merging selected files
- Add a preview feature for selected files in the web interface
- Implement export options for merged content
- Improve the UI/UX with better styling and responsive design
- Process the remaining patterns and create NotebookLM knowledge entries
- Enhance the file selection mechanism to show more details about each file

## Current Status

- Basic web interface created with file selection functionality
- Patterns from the Fabric project have been incorporated
- Project structure has been organized with patterns, research, and notebooklm-knowledge directories
- Memory bank documentation has been updated to reflect current progress
- Web interface is hosted on GitHub Pages
- MIT License has been added to the project

## Known Issues

- The web interface currently only allows selection of files but doesn't implement the merging functionality yet
- File paths in the web interface are hardcoded and may need to be dynamically generated
- The interface doesn't provide a preview of file contents before selection
- No error handling for file operations in the web interface
- Limited responsive design for mobile devices

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initially, the project had separate 'patterns/' and 'knowledge/' directories, but they were merged to simplify the structure
- Decided to use a web interface instead of command-line tools to make the project more accessible to users
- Added MIT license to align with the apparent intent of the Fabric project
- Organized the interface by directory type (Patterns and NotebookLM Knowledge) for better usability
- Implemented a checkbox-based selection system to allow multiple files to be selected simultaneously
