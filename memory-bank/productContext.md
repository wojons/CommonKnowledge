## How It Should Work

The project should function by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the problems outlined in the detailed list above. This will involve implementing features that utilize LLMs for tasks such as text generation, summarization, question answering, conversation, data analysis, and potentially other applications from the detailed list of common uses.

A core component of the project is the creation of a "Common Knowledge Context Pack", which will consist of multiple, distinct instruction sets. Each instruction set will be a self-contained Markdown document section for a specific main topic and its sub-tasks. These instruction sets are now located within the `patterns/` directory.

Each generated instruction set will follow a defined structure:
```markdown
# Instruction Set: [Main Topic Title]

## Core Goal of this Task Area
[Concise paragraph]

## Guiding Principles for Success
* [Bullet points]

## Quality Criteria: What "Good" Looks Like
* [Bullet points]

## Best Practices: How to Execute Effectively
* [Bullet points, including sub-task specifics]

## Common Pitfalls: What to Avoid
* [Bullet points]

## (Optional) Illustrative Example
[Brief example]
```

The approach to generating the content for this pack involves using a "Meta-Prompt" with a suitable LLM to generate these individual instruction sets. This is being explored as an alternative to a single "one-shot" prompt for the entire document or a sequential prompting approach where content for each topic is generated iteratively by a human user. The specific implementation details will depend on the chosen technologies and architecture and the successful generation strategy.
