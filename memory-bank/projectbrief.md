# Project Brief

## Core Requirements and Goals

- Create a comprehensive "Common Knowledge Context Pack" consisting of multiple, distinct instruction sets in Markdown format. This pack will serve as a reusable knowledge base for an AI assistant (like Google NotebookLM) and a human user, providing foundational principles, quality criteria, best practices, and common pitfalls for a wide range of common tasks. The aim is to give NotebookLM a better baseline understanding, making it more versatile and capable beyond just project-specific sources.
