# Research Plan: Analyse Military Strategy

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze military plans and battles, understand decisions, strengths, and weaknesses, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_military_strategy/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_military_strategy/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is military strategy (a plan for a fight or game)?
- How to look at a battle or game and see what the plans were.
- What made a plan strong or weak?
- What happened because of the plan?
- Simple analogies (e.g., planning a strategy for a game of capture the flag).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of military strategy concepts for kids or beginners.
- How to analyze games or competitions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_military_strategy/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_military_strategy/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_military_strategy.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
