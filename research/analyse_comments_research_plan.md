# Research Plan: Analyse Comments

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to evaluate internet comments, categorize their feeling (sentiment), and understand why people praise or criticize, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_comments/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_comments/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are internet comments?
- What is sentiment (the feeling behind the words - happy, sad, angry, neutral)?
- How to figure out if a comment is positive (praise), negative (criticism), or neutral.
- How to understand *why* someone feels that way based on their words.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading notes from friends and figuring out how they feel).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of sentiment analysis.
- How to understand different opinions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_comments/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_comments/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_comments.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
