# Research Plan: Create Art Prompt

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to write instructions for a computer to create art, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_art_prompt/system.md
- knowledge/create_art_prompt/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a computer art program?
- What is a prompt (instructions for the computer)?
- How to describe the picture you want the computer to make.
- How to use words to tell the computer about colors, styles, and ideas.
- Simple analogies (e.g., telling a friend what to draw).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of digital art and prompts for kids.
- How to describe pictures with words.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_art_prompt/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_art_prompt/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_art_prompt.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
