# Research Plan: Create Command

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to figure out the right instructions (commands) to tell a computer to do something specific, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_command/system.md
- knowledge/create_command/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a computer command (an instruction for the computer)?
- How commands have different parts (like the main instruction and extra details).
- How to figure out which command and details you need for a task.
- Simple analogies (e.g., telling a robot exactly what to do and how to do it).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of computer commands and instructions for kids.
- How to give clear instructions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_command/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_command/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_command.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
