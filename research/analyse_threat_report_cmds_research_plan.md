# Research Plan: Analyse Threat Report Commands

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find and understand computer commands related to cybersecurity from reports, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md (relevant for context)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are computer commands (instructions for the computer)?
- What are cybersecurity commands (instructions for finding or stopping computer dangers)?
- How to find these commands in a report.
- How to understand what the commands do.
- Simple analogies (e.g., finding secret codes in a spy book).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of computer commands and cybersecurity for kids.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
