# Research Plan: Analyse Threat Report Trends

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find and understand patterns (trends) in reports about computer dangers, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md (relevant for context)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a trend (something that is happening more or less over time)?
- How to look at information in a report and find trends.
- Why understanding trends is important for staying safe from computer dangers.
- Simple analogies (e.g., noticing if more kids are playing a certain game over time).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of trends and patterns for kids.
- How to spot changes over time.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
