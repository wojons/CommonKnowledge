# Research Plan: Create Logo

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to plan and create a simple picture (logo) to represent something, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_logo/system.md
- knowledge/create_logo/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_art_prompt/system.md (potentially relevant for art concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a logo (a picture that represents a company or idea)?
- Why are logos important?
- What makes a logo simple and easy to remember?
- How to think about ideas for a logo.
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a symbol for your favorite team).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of logos and symbols for kids.
- How to draw simple pictures.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_logo/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_logo/user.md` and `knowledge/create_art_prompt/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_logo.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
