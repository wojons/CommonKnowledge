# Research Plan: Agility Story

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining what user stories and acceptance criteria are and how to create them, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/agility_story/system.md
- knowledge/agility_story/user.md
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a user story (As a [who] I want [what] so that [why])
- What are acceptance criteria (Given, When, Then rules)
- Why are user stories and acceptance criteria used in projects?
- Simple analogies for user stories and acceptance criteria (e.g., building a treehouse, writing a recipe).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of user stories for kids or beginners.
- Examples of simple acceptance criteria.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/agility_story/system.md` and `knowledge/agility_story/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/agility_story.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
