# Research Plan: Analyse Candidates

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to compare and contrast political candidates based on key issues, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_candidates/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_candidates/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What it means to compare and contrast.
- What are key issues in an election?
- How to find information about what candidates think about issues.
- How to compare their ideas simply.
- Simple analogies (e.g., comparing two different toys or games).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of political issues for kids.
- How to compare different viewpoints.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_candidates/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_candidates/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_candidates.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
