# Research Plan: Extract Book Ideas

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find the most interesting and important ideas in a book, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/extract_book_ideas/system.md
- knowledge/extract_book_ideas/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/extract_ideas/system.md (potentially relevant for general idea extraction)
- knowledge/extract_article_wisdom/system.md (potentially relevant for wisdom extraction)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a book?
- How to read a book to find the main ideas.
- What makes an idea interesting or important?
- How to list the key ideas from a book.
- Simple analogies (e.g., finding the main points in a long story).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of reading comprehension and finding main ideas for kids.
- Tips for taking notes from books.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/extract_book_ideas/system.md` and potentially related files like `knowledge/extract_book_ideas/user.md`, `knowledge/extract_ideas/system.md`, and `knowledge/extract_article_wisdom/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/extract_book_ideas.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
