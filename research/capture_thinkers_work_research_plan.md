# Research Plan: Capture Thinkers Work

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze and summarize the ideas of thinkers (like philosophers) to understand what they taught, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/capture_thinkers_work/system.md
- knowledge/capture_thinkers_work/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a thinker or philosopher?
- How to read or listen to their ideas.
- How to find the main points of what they taught.
- How to organize their ideas simply.
- Simple analogies (e.g., summarizing the ideas of a wise character in a story).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of philosophy and thinkers for kids.
- How to summarize ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/capture_thinkers_work/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/capture_thinkers_work/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/capture_thinkers_work.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
