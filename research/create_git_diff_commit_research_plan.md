# Research Plan: Create Git Diff Commit

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to describe changes made to computer code so others can understand them, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_git_diff_commit/system.md
- knowledge/create_git_diff_commit/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is computer code?
- What does it mean to make changes to code?
- What is a "commit" (saving a set of changes)?
- How to write a short message explaining the changes you saved.
- Why explaining your changes is important when working with others.
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing a note about changes you made to a drawing).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of version control (like Git) for kids.
- How to describe changes clearly.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_git_diff_commit/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_git_diff_commit/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_git_diff_commit.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
