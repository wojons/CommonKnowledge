# Research Plan: Extract Business Ideas

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find good ideas for a business from information, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/extract_business_ideas/system.md
- knowledge/extract_business_ideas/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/Business & Strategy/instruction_set.md (relevant for business context)
- knowledge/extract_ideas/system.md (potentially relevant for general idea extraction)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a business idea?
- How to read or listen to information and find ideas for a business.
- What makes a business idea good or special?
- How to list and describe business ideas.
- Simple analogies (e.g., finding ideas for a lemonade stand).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of business ideas for kids.
- How to find and think about new ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/extract_business_ideas/system.md` and potentially related files like `knowledge/extract_business_ideas/user.md`, `knowledge/Business & Strategy/instruction_set.md`, and `knowledge/extract_ideas/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/extract_business_ideas.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
