# Research Plan: Software Development & IT Subject Area

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining key concepts and instructions related to Software Development & IT found in this subject area folder, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/Software Development & IT/instruction_set.md
- Any other relevant files within the knowledge/Software Development & IT/ directory.
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md (to see if any patterns are specifically linked)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- Identify the main topics covered in the `instruction_set.md` and other files.
- Break down complex software development/IT concepts into simple terms.
- Explain the purpose of the instructions provided.
- Simple analogies for software development and IT concepts.

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of basic software development and IT concepts for kids or beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/Software Development & IT/instruction_set.md` and other relevant files in the directory.
2. Identify the core concepts and instructions.
3. Synthesize the information into simple explanations.
4. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/software_development_it.md`).
5. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect progress for this subject area.
