# Research Plan: Analyse Interviewer Techniques

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze how someone asks questions in an interview and what makes them good at it, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_interviewer_techniques/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_interviewer_techniques/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an interview?
- What are techniques (ways of doing something)?
- How to listen to how someone asks questions.
- What makes a question good or helpful?
- How to notice what makes someone a good interviewer.
- Simple analogies (e.g., how a teacher asks questions to help you learn).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of interviewing and questioning techniques for kids or beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_interviewer_techniques/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_interviewer_techniques/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_interviewer_techniques.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
