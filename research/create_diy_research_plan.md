# Research Plan: Create DIY

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining what "Do It Yourself" means and how to create a guide with materials and step-by-step instructions, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_diy/system.md
- knowledge/create_diy/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What "DIY" means.
- The components of a DIY guide (materials/ingredients, steps/instructions).
- How to break down a task into simple steps.
- Why creating a guide is helpful.
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing a recipe, building instructions).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple examples of DIY projects for kids.
- Tips for writing clear instructions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_diy/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_diy/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_diy.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
