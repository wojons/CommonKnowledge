# Research Plan: Analyse Mistakes

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to look at past mistakes in thinking and learn from them to make better decisions in the future, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_mistakes/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_mistakes/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a mistake in thinking?
- How to look back at a mistake and understand what went wrong.
- How our past thinking affects what we believe now.
- How to use mistakes to think better next time.
- Simple analogies (e.g., learning from mistakes in a game or schoolwork).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of learning from mistakes for kids.
- Basic concepts of critical thinking.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_mistakes/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_mistakes/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_mistakes.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
