# Research Plan: Analyze Risk

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to figure out if something is risky and what might go wrong, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_risk/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_risk/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is risk (the chance of something bad happening)?
- How to look at a situation and find possible risks.
- How to think about how likely a risk is and how bad it would be.
- How to think about ways to stop the bad thing from happening or make it less bad.
- Simple analogies (e.g., thinking about the risks of climbing a tall tree).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of risk assessment for kids.
- How to think about safety and potential problems.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_risk/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_risk/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_risk.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
