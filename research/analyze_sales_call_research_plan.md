# Research Plan: Analyze Sales Call

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a sales conversation to see how well it went and what could be done better, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_sales_call/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_sales_call/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a sales call (talking to someone to try and sell something)?
- What makes a sales call good or not so good?
- How to listen for important parts of the conversation.
- How to think about what the salesperson did well and what they could improve.
- Simple analogies (e.g., analyzing how you asked a parent for a new toy).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of sales and communication for kids.
- Tips for talking to people effectively.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_sales_call/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_sales_call/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_sales_call.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
