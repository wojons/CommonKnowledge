# Research Plan: Analyze Prose

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze writing (prose) to see if it's new, clear, and well-written, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose_json/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)
- knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is prose (regular writing)?
- What makes writing new or interesting?
- What makes writing clear and easy to understand?
- What makes writing well-written (good style)?
- How to give suggestions to make writing better.
- Simple analogies (e.g., looking at a drawing to see if it's new, clear, and drawn well).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of writing styles and clarity for kids.
- Tips for writing well.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md` and potentially related files like `knowledge/analyze_prose_json/system.md` and `knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_prose.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
