# Research Plan: Ask Secure By Design Questions

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to ask questions to make sure something is built safely and securely from the beginning, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/ask_secure_by_design_questions/system.md
- knowledge/ask_secure_by_design_questions/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What does "secure by design" mean (building something safely from the start)?
- Why is it important to think about safety early?
- What kind of questions help you think about safety?
- Simple analogies (e.g., planning how to build a safe treehouse).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of safety and security for kids.
- How to ask good questions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/ask_secure_by_design_questions/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/ask_secure_by_design_questions/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/ask_secure_by_design_questions.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
