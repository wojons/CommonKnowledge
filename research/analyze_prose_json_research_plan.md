# Research Plan: Analyze Prose JSON

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze writing (prose) and get the results in a structured computer format (JSON), like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_prose_json/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose_json/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md (relevant for core concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is prose (regular writing)?
- What makes writing new, clear, and well-written? (Referencing concepts from analyze_prose).
- What is JSON (a way computers organize information)?
- How to get the analysis results in a structured way for computers.
- Simple analogies (e.g., putting your drawing analysis into a special box with labels).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of JSON for kids or beginners.
- How to analyze writing (referencing external research from analyze_prose plan).

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_prose_json/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_prose_json/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_prose_json.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
