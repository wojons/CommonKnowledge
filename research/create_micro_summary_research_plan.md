# Research Plan: Create Micro Summary

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make a very, very short summary of information, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_micro_summary/system.md
- knowledge/create_micro_summary/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)
- knowledge/summarize_micro/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a summary (telling the main idea in a short way)?
- What is a *micro* summary (an extra short summary)?
- How to find the most important idea in something you read or heard.
- How to write a summary using only a few words.
- Why making very short summaries is helpful (like for quick notes).
- Simple analogies (e.g., telling a friend the main idea of a story in just one word).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of summarizing for kids.
- How to find the main point quickly.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_micro_summary/system.md` and potentially related files like `knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/system.md` and `knowledge/summarize_micro/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_micro_summary.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
