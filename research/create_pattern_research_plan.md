# Research Plan: Create Pattern

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to create a pattern (like a template or guide) for giving instructions to a computer helper (AI/LLM), like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_pattern/system.md
- knowledge/create_pattern/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/official_pattern_template/system.md (potentially relevant for template structure)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a pattern (a template or guide)?
- What is an AI/LLM (a computer helper that understands words)?
- How to write instructions for a computer helper.
- What parts do good instructions need (like what the helper should do, how it should answer)?
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing instructions for a friend to draw something).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of AI and instructions for kids.
- How to write clear instructions.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_pattern/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_pattern/user.md` and `knowledge/official_pattern_template/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_pattern.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
