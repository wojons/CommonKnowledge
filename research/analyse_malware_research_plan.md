# Research Plan: Analyse Malware

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze computer viruses or harmful software (malware) to understand what they do and how to stop them, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_malware/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_malware/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is malware (harmful computer programs)?
- What kind of clues do you look for when analyzing malware (how it spreads, what it harms)?
- How to find ways to detect and stop malware.
- Simple analogies (e.g., studying a sickness to find out how it spreads and how to cure it).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of computer viruses and malware for kids or beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_malware/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_malware/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_malware.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
