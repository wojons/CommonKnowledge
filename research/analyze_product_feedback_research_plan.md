# Research Plan: Analyze Product Feedback

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to look at what people say about a product (feedback) and organize it to understand what they like and don't like, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_product_feedback/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_product_feedback/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is product feedback (what people think about something they used)?
- How to read or listen to feedback.
- How to group similar ideas together.
- How to figure out which feedback is most important.
- Simple analogies (e.g., getting notes from friends about a game you made).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of feedback and suggestions for kids.
- How to organize ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_product_feedback/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_product_feedback/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_product_feedback.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
