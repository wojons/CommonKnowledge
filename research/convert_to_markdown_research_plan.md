# Research Plan: Convert to Markdown

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to change different kinds of writing into a simple format called Markdown, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/convert_to_markdown/system.md
- knowledge/convert_to_markdown/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is Markdown (a simple way to format text)?
- Why is Markdown useful (easy to read and use)?
- How to change different types of writing (like from a website or another document) into Markdown.
- Simple analogies (e.g., changing messy handwriting into neat printing).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of Markdown for kids or beginners.
- How to format text simply.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/convert_to_markdown/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/convert_to_markdown/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/convert_to_markdown.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
