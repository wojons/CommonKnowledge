# Research Plan: Create Flash Cards

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make flashcards to help you remember things, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_flash_cards/system.md
- knowledge/create_flash_cards/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/to_flashcards/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are flashcards (cards with a question on one side and the answer on the other)?
- Why are flashcards helpful for studying?
- How to choose what information to put on a flashcard.
- How to write a good question and a clear answer.
- Simple analogies (e.g., making cards to remember animal names).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of flashcards and studying for kids.
- Tips for remembering information.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_flash_cards/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_flash_cards/user.md` and `knowledge/to_flashcards/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_flash_cards.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
