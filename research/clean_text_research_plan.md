# Research Plan: Clean Text

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to fix messy writing (text) to make it neat and easy to read, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/clean_text/system.md
- knowledge/clean_text/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is messy text (like words with mistakes or weird spaces)?
- How to find and fix mistakes like extra spaces, wrong capitalization, or missing periods.
- Why clean text is important for reading and understanding.
- Simple analogies (e.g., cleaning up a messy drawing).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of grammar and punctuation for kids.
- Tips for making writing clear.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/clean_text/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/clean_text/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/clean_text.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
