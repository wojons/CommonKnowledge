# Research Plan: Analyze Threat Report

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a report about computer dangers (threat report) to find important information and trends, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/system.md (potentially relevant)
- knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/system.md (potentially relevant)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a threat report (a report about computer dangers)?
- How to find surprising or interesting things in the report.
- How to look for patterns or things that are happening a lot (trends).
- How to find important facts, quotes, or recommendations.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading a report about dangers in a game or on a playground).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of cybersecurity threats and reports for kids.
- How to find important information in a document.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md` and potentially related files like `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_cmds/system.md` and `knowledge/analyse_threat_report_trends/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_threat_report.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
