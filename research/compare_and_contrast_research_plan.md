# Research Plan: Compare and Contrast

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to compare and contrast different things to see how they are similar and different, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/compare_and_contrast/system.md
- knowledge/compare_and_contrast/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What does it mean to compare (find similarities)?
- What does it mean to contrast (find differences)?
- How to look at two or more things and find ways they are alike and different.
- How to organize your ideas about similarities and differences.
- Simple analogies (e.g., comparing two different animals or toys).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of comparing and contrasting for kids.
- How to organize information in a table.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/compare_and_contrast/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/compare_and_contrast/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/compare_and_contrast.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
