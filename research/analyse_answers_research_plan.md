# Research Plan: Analyse Answers

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to evaluate quiz answers based on learning objectives, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_answers/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_answers/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are quiz answers and learning objectives?
- How to compare an answer to what you were supposed to learn (the objective).
- How to decide if an answer is correct or incorrect based on the objective.
- Simple analogies (e.g., checking if a puzzle piece fits the picture).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of learning objectives and assessment.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_answers/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_answers/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_answers.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
