# Research Plan: Analyse Claims

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze truth claims, identify evidence, counter-evidence, and logical fallacies, and rate the claims, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_claims/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_claims/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/find_logical_fallacies/system.md (potentially relevant for explaining fallacies)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a truth claim?
- What is evidence (supporting clues)?
- What is counter-evidence (opposite clues)?
- What are logical fallacies (tricky talk/thinking mistakes)?
- How to evaluate a claim based on evidence and fallacies.
- Simple analogies (e.g., being a truth detective).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of logical fallacies for kids or beginners.
- Examples of simple claims and how to find evidence for/against them.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_claims/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_claims/user.md` and `knowledge/find_logical_fallacies/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_claims.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
