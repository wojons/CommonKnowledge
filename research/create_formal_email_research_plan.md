# Research Plan: Create Formal Email

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to write a polite and proper email for important messages, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_formal_email/system.md
- knowledge/create_formal_email/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a formal email (an email for important or serious messages)?
- How is it different from a regular email to a friend?
- What parts does a formal email need (like a clear subject, polite greeting, main message, polite closing)?
- Why is it important to be clear and polite in formal emails?
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing a polite letter to a teacher).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of formal writing and email etiquette for kids.
- How to write polite messages.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_formal_email/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_formal_email/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_formal_email.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
