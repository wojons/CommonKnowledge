# Research Plan: Extract Book Recommendations

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find practical advice and suggestions in a book, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/extract_book_recommendations/system.md
- knowledge/extract_book_recommendations/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/extract_recommendations/system.md (potentially relevant for general recommendations)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a recommendation (advice on what to do)?
- How to read a book and find the advice the author gives.
- How to list the helpful suggestions from a book.
- Why finding recommendations is useful.
- Simple analogies (e.g., finding tips in a guide book).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of recommendations and advice for kids.
- How to find helpful tips in reading.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/extract_book_recommendations/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/extract_book_recommendations/user.md` and `knowledge/extract_recommendations/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/extract_book_recommendations.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
