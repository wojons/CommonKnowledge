# Research Plan: Create Network Threat Landscape

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to understand the dangers (threats) to computer networks, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_network_threat_landscape/system.md
- knowledge/create_network_threat_landscape/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md (relevant for context)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a computer network (computers connected together)?
- What are threats to a network (dangers like viruses or hackers)?
- How to find out what parts of a network might be in danger.
- How to make a report about the dangers.
- Simple analogies (e.g., understanding the dangers to a group of friends playing together).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of computer networks and cybersecurity for kids.
- How to identify potential problems.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_network_threat_landscape/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_network_threat_landscape/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_network_threat_landscape.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
