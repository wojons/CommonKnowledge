# Research Plan: Analyze Prose Pinker

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze writing (prose) based on ideas from Steven Pinker's book, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md (relevant for core concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is prose (regular writing)?
- Who is Steven Pinker and what is his book about writing?
- What are some of Pinker's ideas about good and bad writing?
- How to look at writing and see if it follows Pinker's ideas.
- Simple analogies (e.g., using a famous artist's tips to look at a drawing).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of Steven Pinker's ideas on writing for kids or beginners.
- Tips for writing well (referencing external research from analyze_prose plan).

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_prose/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation, focusing on Pinker's ideas.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_prose_pinker.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
