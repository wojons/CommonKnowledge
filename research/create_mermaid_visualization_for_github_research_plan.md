# Research Plan: Create Mermaid Visualization For Github

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make special drawings (visualizations) called Mermaid diagrams that work well on websites like GitHub, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization_for_github/system.md
- knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization_for_github/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization/system.md (relevant for core concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a visualization (a drawing or picture to show an idea)?
- What is a Mermaid diagram (a special kind of drawing using text)?
- What is GitHub (a website where people share computer code and ideas)?
- How to make Mermaid drawings that look good on GitHub.
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a picture that looks good in a specific book).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of GitHub and Mermaid for kids or beginners.
- How to share drawings online.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization_for_github/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization_for_github/user.md` and `knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_mermaid_visualization_for_github.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
