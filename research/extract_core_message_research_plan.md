# Research Plan: Extract Core Message

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to find the main idea or most important point in something you read or hear, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/extract_core_message/system.md
- knowledge/extract_core_message/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/extract_main_idea/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is the core message (the main idea)?
- How to read or listen carefully to find the most important point.
- How to say the main idea in a short sentence.
- Why finding the main idea is important for understanding.
- Simple analogies (e.g., finding the main point of a story).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of finding main ideas for kids.
- How to summarize information.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/extract_core_message/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/extract_core_message/user.md` and `knowledge/extract_main_idea/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/extract_core_message.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
