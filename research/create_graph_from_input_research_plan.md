# Research Plan: Create Graph From Input

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make a graph (a picture that shows numbers) from information, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_graph_from_input/system.md
- knowledge/create_graph_from_input/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_ttrc_graph/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a graph (a picture that shows numbers or data)?
- Why are graphs helpful for understanding information?
- How to look at numbers and figure out how to draw a graph.
- What are the parts of a graph (like the lines and labels)?
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a chart to show how many kids like different colors).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of graphs and data visualization for kids.
- How to draw charts.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_graph_from_input/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_graph_from_input/user.md` and `knowledge/create_ttrc_graph/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_graph_from_input.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
