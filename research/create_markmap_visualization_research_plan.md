# Research Plan: Create Markmap Visualization

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make special drawings (visualizations) called Markmaps to show how ideas are connected, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_markmap_visualization/system.md
- knowledge/create_markmap_visualization/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_visualization/system.md (potentially relevant for general visualization concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a visualization (a drawing or picture to show an idea)?
- What is a Markmap (a special kind of drawing that shows connected ideas)?
- Why are these drawings helpful for understanding complex ideas?
- How to make a Markmap drawing to show how different ideas link together.
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a map of your thoughts).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of mind maps and diagrams for kids.
- How to show connections between ideas visually.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_markmap_visualization/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_markmap_visualization/user.md` and `knowledge/create_visualization/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_markmap_visualization.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
