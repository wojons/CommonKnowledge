# Research Plan: Create Better Frame

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to think about things in a helpful and positive way, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_better_frame/system.md
- knowledge/create_better_frame/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a "frame" (how you see or think about something)?
- How different frames can change how you feel or what you do.
- How to choose a helpful or positive frame.
- Why thinking positively can be helpful.
- Simple analogies (e.g., looking at a picture with different colored glasses).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of positive thinking and perspective for kids.
- How to change your mindset.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_better_frame/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_better_frame/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_better_frame.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
