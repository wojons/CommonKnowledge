# Research Plan: Coding Master

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining a coding concept to a beginner, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/coding_master/system.md
- knowledge/coding_master/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is coding (giving instructions to a computer)?
- How to explain a coding idea simply.
- How to use examples to help someone learn.
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing instructions for a robot).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of basic coding concepts for kids.
- Tips for teaching beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/coding_master/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/coding_master/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/coding_master.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
