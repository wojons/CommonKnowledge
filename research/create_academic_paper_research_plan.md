# Research Plan: Create Academic Paper

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to write a school paper (academic paper) with clear ideas and a good structure, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_academic_paper/system.md
- knowledge/create_academic_paper/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an academic paper (a school paper about a topic)?
- How to choose a topic and find information.
- How to organize your ideas with an introduction, body, and conclusion.
- How to write clearly and use proper formatting.
- Simple analogies (e.g., writing a report about a science project).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of academic writing and research for kids.
- How to structure a report.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_academic_paper/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_academic_paper/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_academic_paper.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
