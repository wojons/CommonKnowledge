# Research Plan: Check Agreement

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to look at agreements or contracts to find important parts and potential problems, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/check_agreement/system.md
- knowledge/check_agreement/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an agreement or contract (like rules people agree to follow)?
- Why is it important to read agreements carefully?
- How to find the main points in an agreement.
- How to look for things that might be tricky or cause problems.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading the rules of a game before you play).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of contracts and agreements for kids.
- How to read carefully and spot important details.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/check_agreement/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/check_agreement/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/check_agreement.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
