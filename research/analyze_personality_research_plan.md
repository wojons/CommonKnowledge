# Research Plan: Analyze Personality

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a person's personality based on their behavior and words, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_personality/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_personality/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is personality?
- How can you learn about someone's personality by watching and listening?
- What are some different parts of personality?
- Simple analogies (e.g., figuring out if a character in a book is brave or shy).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of personality traits for kids.
- How to observe and understand people.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_personality/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_personality/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_personality.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
