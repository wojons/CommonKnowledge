# Research Plan: Create Idea Compass

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to organize ideas to understand them better, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_idea_compass/system.md
- knowledge/create_idea_compass/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an idea?
- How to break down an idea into smaller parts.
- How to think about where an idea came from and what it leads to.
- How to organize your thoughts about an idea.
- Simple analogies (e.g., using a map to explore an idea).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of organizing ideas for kids.
- How to brainstorm and explore topics.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_idea_compass/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_idea_compass/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_idea_compass.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
