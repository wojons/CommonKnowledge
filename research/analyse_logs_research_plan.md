# Research Plan: Analyse Logs

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to look at computer logs (records of what happened) to find problems or interesting things, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_logs/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_logs/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are computer logs (like a diary for the computer)?
- What kind of information is in logs (when things happened, what programs did)?
- How to look for patterns or things that look strange in the logs.
- Why looking at logs is helpful for fixing problems.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading a diary to see what happened on a day).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of computer logs and troubleshooting for kids or beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_logs/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_logs/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_logs.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
