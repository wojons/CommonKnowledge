# Research Plan: Ask Uncle Duke

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to use AI helpers (agents) to research and solve software development problems, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/ask_uncle_duke/system.md
- knowledge/ask_uncle_duke/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are AI agents (computer helpers)?
- How can AI agents work together like a team?
- How can they help with building computer programs?
- What is a code review (checking the computer instructions)?
- Simple analogies (e.g., having a team of robot helpers build something and then checking their work).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of AI agents and collaboration for kids.
- What is software development (building computer programs)?

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/ask_uncle_duke/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/ask_uncle_duke/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/ask_uncle_duke.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
