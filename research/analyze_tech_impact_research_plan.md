# Research Plan: Analyze Tech Impact

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to think about how new technology affects people and the world, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_tech_impact/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_tech_impact/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is technology?
- How does technology change things for people (good and bad)?
- How to think about if technology is fair or unfair.
- How to think about if technology is good for the planet.
- Simple analogies (e.g., how a new invention like a bicycle changed things).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of technology and its effects for kids.
- How to think about fairness and the environment.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_tech_impact/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_tech_impact/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_tech_impact.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
