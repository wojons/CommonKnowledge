# Research Plan: Create NPC

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to create a character for a game (NPC) with a personality and story, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_npc/system.md
- knowledge/create_npc/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_personality/system.md (potentially relevant for personality concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an NPC (a character in a game that a player doesn't control)?
- What makes a character interesting (like their personality, what they want)?
- How to come up with ideas for a character's story and traits.
- How to write down the important details about a character.
- Simple analogies (e.g., making up a character for a pretend game).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of character creation for kids.
- How to write stories.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_npc/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_npc/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_personality/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_npc.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
