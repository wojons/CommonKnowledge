# Research Plan: Create Coding Feature

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to plan and build a small part (feature) of a computer program, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_coding_feature/system.md
- knowledge/create_coding_feature/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/coding_master/system.md (relevant for coding concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a computer program?
- What is a feature (a small part that does something specific)?
- How to think about what a feature needs to do.
- How to plan the steps to build the feature.
- Simple analogies (e.g., planning how to build a specific part of a toy).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of software features and planning for kids.
- How to break down big tasks into small steps.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_coding_feature/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_coding_feature/user.md` and `knowledge/coding_master/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_coding_feature.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
