# Research Plan: Analyze Presentation

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a presentation (like a school project or talk) to understand what the speaker is trying to say and if it's interesting, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_presentation/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_presentation/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a presentation?
- How to listen for the main ideas in a presentation.
- How to tell if the speaker is focusing on the audience or just themselves.
- What makes a presentation interesting or boring?
- Simple analogies (e.g., watching someone share their favorite toy).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of presentations and public speaking for kids.
- How to be a good listener.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_presentation/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_presentation/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_presentation.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
