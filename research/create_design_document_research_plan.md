# Research Plan: Create Design Document

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to create a document that plans out how something (like a computer program) will be built, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_design_document/system.md
- knowledge/create_design_document/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a design document (a plan for building something)?
- Why is planning important before building?
- What kind of information goes into a design document (what it will do, how it will work)?
- What is a diagram (a picture that shows how things connect)?
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a blueprint before building a treehouse).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of design and planning for kids.
- How to draw simple diagrams.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_design_document/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_design_document/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_design_document.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
