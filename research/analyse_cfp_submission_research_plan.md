# Research Plan: Analyse CFP Submission

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to review and evaluate conference speaking proposals (CFP submissions), like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_cfp_submission/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_cfp_submission/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a conference and why do people give talks?
- What is a CFP (Call for Proposals)?
- What makes a good talk idea or proposal? (Clarity, relevance, interesting topic).
- How to read a proposal and decide if it would be a good talk.
- Simple analogies (e.g., picking the best idea for show and tell).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of conferences and speaking proposals.
- Tips for evaluating ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_cfp_submission/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_cfp_submission/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_cfp_submission.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
