# Research Plan: Create AI Jobs Analysis

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how AI (computer helpers) might change jobs and how people can get ready, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_ai_jobs_analysis/system.md
- knowledge/create_ai_jobs_analysis/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/ai/system.md (relevant for AI context)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is AI (computer helpers that can learn)?
- How might AI do some jobs that people do now?
- What kinds of jobs might still need people?
- How can people learn new things to be ready for future jobs?
- Simple analogies (e.g., how machines changed jobs in the past).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of AI and jobs for kids.
- How to learn new skills.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_ai_jobs_analysis/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_ai_jobs_analysis/user.md` and `knowledge/ai/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_ai_jobs_analysis.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
