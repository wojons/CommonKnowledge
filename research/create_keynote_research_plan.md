# Research Plan: Create Keynote

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to plan and create a special kind of talk (keynote presentation) that shares important ideas, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_keynote/system.md
- knowledge/create_keynote/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_presentation/system.md (potentially relevant for presentation concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a keynote presentation (an important talk at an event)?
- What makes a talk interesting and impactful?
- How to organize your ideas for a talk (introduction, main points, conclusion).
- How to create simple slides or pictures to help people understand.
- Simple analogies (e.g., planning a special show and tell).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of public speaking and presentations for kids.
- Tips for telling a good story.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_keynote/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_keynote/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_presentation/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_keynote.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
