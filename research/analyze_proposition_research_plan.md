# Research Plan: Analyze Proposition

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a proposition (like an idea for a rule or change) to understand what it is and who agrees or disagrees, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_proposition/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_proposition/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a proposition (an idea for a change)?
- How to figure out what the proposition is asking for.
- How to find out who is for it and who is against it, and why.
- Simple analogies (e.g., deciding on a new rule for a game).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of propositions and voting for kids.
- How to understand different sides of an issue.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_proposition/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_proposition/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_proposition.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
