# Research Plan: Analyse Paper

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a research paper, understand its main ideas, and figure out if it's good, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_paper/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_paper/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a research paper?
- How to find the main points and findings in a paper.
- How to think about if the research is done well.
- Why analyzing papers is important for learning new things.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading a report about an experiment).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of research papers and how to read them for kids or beginners.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_paper/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_paper/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_paper.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
