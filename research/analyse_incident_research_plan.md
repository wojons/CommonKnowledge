# Research Plan: Analyse Incident

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to break down information about a cybersecurity incident (like a computer problem or hack) to understand what happened, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_incident/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_incident/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a cybersecurity incident (a computer problem or attack)?
- What kind of information is important to find out (who did it, what happened, what was affected, how to fix it)?
- How to organize the information to make sense of it.
- Simple analogies (e.g., figuring out what happened when a toy broke).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of cybersecurity incidents for kids or beginners.
- How to gather information like a detective.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_incident/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_incident/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_incident.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
