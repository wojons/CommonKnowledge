# Research Plan: Create Cyber Summary

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make a short summary about computer dangers (cybersecurity threats), like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_cyber_summary/system.md
- knowledge/create_cyber_summary/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md (relevant for context)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What are cybersecurity threats (dangers to computers and information)?
- How to find the most important information about a threat.
- How to write a very short summary about the threat.
- How to list important details in a simple way.
- Simple analogies (e.g., making a safety report about dangers on the playground).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of cybersecurity for kids.
- How to summarize important information.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_cyber_summary/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_cyber_summary/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_threat_report/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_cyber_summary.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
