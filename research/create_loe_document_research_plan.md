# Research Plan: Create LOE Document

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to create a document that estimates how much work something will take (Level of Effort), like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_loe_document/system.md
- knowledge/create_loe_document/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is Level of Effort (LOE) (how much work something needs)?
- Why is it important to estimate how much work something will take?
- How to think about the different parts of a task and guess how long each part will take.
- How to put your guesses together to get a total estimate.
- Simple analogies (e.g., guessing how long it will take to build a Lego set).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of estimation and planning for kids.
- How to break down tasks.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_loe_document/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_loe_document/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_loe_document.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
