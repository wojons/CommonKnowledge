# Research Plan: Create Aphorisms

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining what aphorisms are and how to create short, wise sayings, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_aphorisms/system.md
- knowledge/create_aphorisms/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an aphorism (a short, wise saying)?
- How to think of a wise idea.
- How to write a wise idea in a short and memorable way.
- Simple analogies (e.g., making up a wise rule for your friends).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of proverbs and sayings for kids.
- How to write short, impactful sentences.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_aphorisms/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_aphorisms/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_aphorisms.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
