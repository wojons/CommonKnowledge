# Research Plan: Answer Interview Question

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to answer questions in an interview, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/answer_interview_question/system.md
- knowledge/answer_interview_question/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an interview?
- How to listen carefully to a question.
- How to think about the best way to answer based on what the interviewer wants to know.
- How to give examples to show what you know.
- Simple analogies (e.g., answering questions in class).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of interviews and answering questions for kids.
- Tips for talking about yourself.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/answer_interview_question/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/answer_interview_question/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/answer_interview_question.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
