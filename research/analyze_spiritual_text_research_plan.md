# Research Plan: Analyze Spiritual Text

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze spiritual texts and compare them, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_spiritual_text/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_spiritual_text/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a spiritual text?
- How to read and understand ideas in a spiritual text.
- How to compare ideas from different spiritual texts.
- Simple analogies (e.g., comparing stories from different cultures).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of different spiritual concepts for kids.
- How to compare different kinds of stories or beliefs.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_spiritual_text/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_spiritual_text/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_spiritual_text.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
