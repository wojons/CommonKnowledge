# Research Plan: Analyze Bill Short

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a short bill (like a proposed law) to quickly understand its main points, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_bill_short/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_bill_short/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/analyze_bill/system.md (potentially relevant for comparison)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a bill (a proposed rule or law)?
- How to quickly find the main idea of a short bill.
- What are the most important parts to look for?
- How is analyzing a short bill different from a long one?
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading a short note vs. a long letter).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of short legislative texts for kids.
- Tips for summarizing information quickly.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_bill_short/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_bill_short/user.md` and `knowledge/analyze_bill/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_bill_short.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
