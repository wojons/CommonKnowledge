# Research Plan: Explain Math

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining math ideas in a clear and fun way, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/explain_math/system.md
- knowledge/explain_math/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is math?
- How to break down a math idea into simple parts.
- How to use examples or drawings to help understand math.
- Why math is useful.
- Simple analogies (e.g., using blocks to understand adding).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of basic math concepts for kids.
- Fun ways to learn math.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/explain_math/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/explain_math/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/explain_math.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
