# Research Plan: Analyze Bill

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a bill (like a proposed law) to understand what it's about and what it might do, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyze_bill/system.md
- knowledge/analyze_bill/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a bill (a proposed rule or law)?
- How to read a bill to find out its main idea.
- What are the important parts of a bill?
- How to think about who the bill might affect and how.
- Simple analogies (e.g., reading the rules for a new game).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of how laws are made for kids.
- How to understand rules and their effects.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyze_bill/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyze_bill/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyze_bill.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
