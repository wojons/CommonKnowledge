# Research Plan: Create Excalidraw Visualization

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make simple drawings (visualizations) to show ideas, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_excalidraw_visualization/system.md
- knowledge/create_excalidraw_visualization/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md
- knowledge/create_visualization/system.md (potentially relevant for general visualization concepts)

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a visualization (a drawing or picture to show an idea)?
- Why are drawings helpful for understanding?
- How to make a simple drawing to show how things connect or work.
- Simple analogies (e.g., drawing a map to show how to get somewhere).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of diagrams and drawings for kids.
- How to draw to explain ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_excalidraw_visualization/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_excalidraw_visualization/user.md` and `knowledge/create_visualization/system.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_excalidraw_visualization.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
