# Research Plan: Analyse Debate

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to analyze a debate, understand different arguments, and see where people agree or disagree, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/analyse_debate/system.md
- knowledge/analyse_debate/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a debate?
- What is an argument (a reason someone believes something)?
- How to listen for different arguments.
- How to see where people agree and disagree.
- How to think about who has stronger reasons (without picking sides).
- Simple analogies (e.g., friends arguing about which game is better).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of debates and arguments for kids.
- How to listen actively and identify points.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/analyse_debate/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/analyse_debate/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/analyse_debate.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
