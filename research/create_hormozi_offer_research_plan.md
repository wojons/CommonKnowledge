# Research Plan: Create Hormozi Offer

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to create a good offer for selling something, based on ideas from a business person named Alex Hormozi, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_hormozi_offer/system.md
- knowledge/create_hormozi_offer/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is an offer (what you give someone when you sell something)?
- What makes an offer good or attractive?
- Who is Alex Hormozi and what are some of his ideas about offers?
- How to think about what someone really wants and needs.
- Simple analogies (e.g., making a good trade with a friend).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of business and selling for kids.
- Basic ideas about value and trading.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_hormozi_offer/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_hormozi_offer/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_hormozi_offer.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
