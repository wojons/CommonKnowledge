# Research Plan: Create 5 Sentence Summary

**Goal:** To create simple, understandable knowledge for NotebookLM explaining how to make very short summaries of information, like explaining to a 5th grader.

**Relevant Internal Files:**
- knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/system.md
- knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/user.md (if exists and contains relevant info)
- patterns/pattern_explanations.md

**Key Concepts to Understand and Explain Simply:**
- What is a summary (telling the main idea in a short way)?
- How to find the most important parts of something you read or heard.
- How to write a very short summary (like 5 sentences or even fewer words).
- Why making summaries is helpful.
- Simple analogies (e.g., telling a friend about a movie in just a few sentences).

**Potential External Research Topics:**
- Simple explanations of summarizing for kids.
- How to find main ideas.

**Steps to Take in ACT MODE:**
1. Read `knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/system.md` and potentially `knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary/user.md`.
2. Synthesize the information from these files and the key concepts into a simple explanation.
3. Write the simplified knowledge into a new file (location to be determined, e.g., `notebooklm-knowledge/create_5_sentence_summary.md`).
4. Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`) to reflect completion for this pattern.
